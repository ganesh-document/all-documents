# **Get tips and tricks for teaching AZ-500 Microsoft Azure Security Technologies**

**Introduction**

Virtual Educator Prep Sessions (VEPS) are part of the Microsoft Learn for Educators (MSLE) program, and they're a critical piece of preparing to teach Microsoft technical skills as a part of our program. MSLE is anchored in the belief that higher education institutions and faculty members play a pivotal role in empowering students for future success. We at Microsoft are committed to supporting students, faculty members, and higher education institutions with free curriculum training and tools for teaching technical skills.

In this module, you'll learn tips and tricks from Microsoft technical trainers about preparing for your first teaching session. You'll learn which labs to use, and how to introduce technical topics. You'll also discover other resources and materials that may help your students succeed on their Microsoft certification exams.


**Understand the objective domains**

In the AZ-500: Microsoft Azure Security Technologies course, all of the topics that are covered are related to Azure infrastructure and map directly to Exam AZ-500: Microsoft Azure Security Technologies. Percentages indicate the relative weight of each area on the exam. The higher the percentage, the more questions you're likely to see in that area. For the latest breakdown, select the AZ-500 study guide hyperlink in the Tip section of the AZ-500: Microsoft Azure Security Technologies certification page.

Become familiar with the objective domains, which are a comprehensive set of specific and measurable knowledge, skills, and abilities that are the basis for the development of both this course and the certification exam.

   - Module 1: Identity and Access
   - Module 2: Implement Platform Protection
   - Module 3: Data and Application Security
   - Module 4: Security Operations

Remember that each module points back to the core theme of Azure security and how security and Azure and Cloud technologies are vitally important. Details for each module are included in the corresponding module best practice sections below.

**Learn module best practices**

As an educator, you play a pivotal role in empowering students for future success. Skilling our future generations is critical work. The AZ-500: Microsoft Azure Security Technologies course exposes students to the Azure security engineer role. The Azure security engineer is skilled at performing the following tasks:

   - Managing the security posture
   - Identifying and remediating vulnerabilities
   - Performing threat modeling
   - Implementing threat protection
   - Responding to security incident escalations

Azure security engineers often serve as part of a larger team to plan and implement cloud-based management and security.

Students preparing for this exam should have practical experience in administration of Azure and hybrid environments, along with experience with:

   - Infrastructure as code
   - Security operations processes
   - Cloud capabilities
   - Azure services


Before we begin, make sure you're using the most up-to-date version of the Microsoft Official Curriculum (MOC). It's recommended that you log into the Learning Download Center (LDC) at least quarterly. If you haven't already done so, please download the course materials from the LDC before continuing with this module.

Now that you have the updated materials, you’re ready to prepare for your class.


**Explore the best practices for AZ-500 Microsoft Azure Security Technologies Module 1**

As you're preparing to teach this module, get familiar with what the students will learn during the module – the concepts and methodologies they'll be working through. In this module, students will explore how identity is the starting point for all security and learn to authenticate and authorize users and apps with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Students will also explore creating and managing user and group accounts in Azure AD.

This module consists of five lessons:

   - Lesson 1 – Secure Azure solutions with Azure AD
   - Lesson 2 – Implement Hybrid identity
   - Lesson 3 – Deploy Azure AD identity protection
   - Lesson 4 – Configure Azure AD privileged identity management
   - Lesson 5 – Design an enterprise governance strategy


**Module 1 Tips and Tricks**

   - Use real-world applications of Azure AD
   - Emphasize the difference between Active Directory and Azure AD
   - Explain that Azure AD is an internet service
   - Utilize Microsoft Whiteboard during instruction
   - Clarify tenant, directory, and subscription
   - Consider using real-word examples
     - Consider using Microsoft customer stories
   - Consider presenting the labs as demonstrations 
     - Students will need access to the Azure portal and credentials that need to be validated to complete the labs


**Explore the best practices for AZ-500 Microsoft Azure Security Technologies Module 2**

As you're preparing to teach this module, get familiar with what the students will learn during the module. In this module, students will learn about how security has to happen at all levels and how to lock down the infrastructure and network resources that are running in an Azure environment.

This module consists of four lessons:

   - Lesson 1 – Implement perimeter security
   - Lesson 2 – Configure network security
   - Lesson 3 – Configure and manage host security
   - Lesson 4 – Enable Containers security


**Module 2 Tips and Tricks**

   - Consider starting the conversation on the concepts of Defense in Depth – layers of security
   - Explain the host and Container security focus on securing the VM
   - Consider presenting the labs as demonstrations 

**Explore the best practices for AZ-500 Microsoft Azure Security Technologies Module 3**

As you're preparing to teach this module, get familiar with what the students will learn during the module. In this module, students will learn that the applications that run within Azure and access confidential data will need to be locked down. Students will learn how to secure applications, storage, databases, and key vaults.

This module consists of four lessons:

   - Lesson 1 – Deploy and secure Azure Key Vault
   - Lesson 2 – Configure application security features
   - Lesson 3 – Implement storage security
   - Lesson 4 – Configure and manage SQL database security


**Module 3 Tips and Tricks**

   - Explain how Key Vault and Managed IDs are the center of application security, so password and access credentials don’t need to be included in code.
   - Differentiate between managed ID vs. service principals
   - Emphasize how different skill levels and tool knowledge can be applied in Azure
   - Ensure your students are comfortable with Certificates and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)


**Explore the best practices for AZ-500 Microsoft Azure Security Technologies Module 4**
