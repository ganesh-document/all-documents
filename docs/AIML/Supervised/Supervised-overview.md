### ** What is Supervised Learning?**

- In supervised learning, sample labeled data are provided to the machine learning system for training, and the system then predicts the output based on the training data.
- The system uses labeled data to build a model that understands the datasets and learns about each one.
- After the training and processing are done, we test the model with sample data to see if it can accurately predict the output.
- The mapping of the input data to the output data is the objective of supervised learning.
