Adding on key rolling, secure storage, and detailed audit logs is almost impossible without a custom solution.

Each policy is path-based and policy rules constrains the actions and accessibility to the paths for each client. With Vault, you can create tokens manually and assign them to your clients, or the clients can log in and obtain a token. The illustration below displays Vault's core workflow.</p> <p></p> <p>The core Vault workflow consists of four stages:</p> <ul> <li>Authenticate: Authentication in Vault is the process by which a client supplies information that Vault uses to determine if they are who they say they are. Once the client is authenticated against an auth method, a token is generated and associated to a policy.</li> <li>Validation: Vault validates the client against third-party trusted sources, such as Github, LDAP, AppRole, and more.</li> <li>Authorize: A client is matched against the Vault security policy. This policy is a set of rules defining which API endpoints a client has access to with its Vault token. Policies provide a declarative way to grant or forbid access to certain paths and operations in Vault.</li> <li>Access: Vault grants access to secrets, keys, and encryption capabilities by issuing a token based on policies associated with the client\u2019s identity. The client can then use their Vault token for future operations.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Security/Hashicorp-vault/Hashicorp-vault.html#why-vault","title":"Why Vault?","text":"<p>Most enterprises today have credentials sprawled across their organizations. Passwords, API keys, and credentials are stored in plain text, app source code, config files, and other locations. Because these credentials live everywhere, the sprawl can make it difficult and daunting to really know who has access and authorization to what. Having credentials in plain text also increases the potential for malicious attacks, both by internal and external attackers.</p> <p>Vault was designed with these challenges in mind. Vault takes all of these credentials and centralizes them so that they are defined in one location, which reduces unwanted exposure to credentials. But Vault takes it a few steps further by making sure users, apps, and systems are authenticated and explicitly authorized to access resources, while also providing an audit trail that captures and preserves a history of clients' actions.</p> <p>The key features of Vault are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Secure Secret Storage: Arbitrary key/value secrets can be stored in Vault. Vault encrypts these secrets prior to writing them to persistent storage, so gaining access to the raw storage isn't enough to access your secrets. Vault can write to disk, Consul, and more.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dynamic Secrets: Vault can generate secrets on-demand for some systems, such as AWS or SQL databases. For example, when an application needs to access an S3 bucket, it asks Vault for credentials, and Vault will generate an AWS keypair with valid permissions on demand. After creating these dynamic secrets, Vault will also automatically revoke them after the lease is up.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data Encryption: Vault can encrypt and decrypt data without storing it. This allows security teams to define encryption parameters and developers to store encrypted data in a location such as a SQL database without having to design their own encryption methods.</p> </li> <li> <p>Leasing and Renewal: All secrets in Vault have a lease associated with them. At the end of the lease, Vault will automatically revoke that secret. Clients are able to renew leases via built-in renew APIs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Revocation: Vault has built-in support for secret revocation. Vault can revoke not only single secrets, but a tree of secrets, for example all secrets read by a specific user, or all secrets of a particular type. Revocation assists in key rolling as well as locking down systems in the case of an intrusion.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Security/Hashicorp-vault/Hashicorp-vault.html#what-is-hcp-vault","title":"What is HCP Vault?","text":"<p>HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) Vault is a hosted version of Vault, which is operated by HashiCorp to allow organizations to get up and running quickly.

Other secrets engines connect to other services and generate dynamic credentials on demand. Other secrets engines provide encryption as a service, totp generation, certificates, and much more.</p> <p>Secrets engines are enabled at a path in Vault. When a request comes to Vault, the router automatically routes anything with the route prefix to the secrets engine. In this way, each secrets engine defines its own paths and properties.

By default, they are enabled at their \"type\" (e.g. \"aws\" enables at aws/).</li> </ul> <pre><code>Case-sensitive: The path where you enable secrets engines is case-sensitive. For example, the KV secrets engine enabled at kv/ and KV/ are treated as two distinct instances of KV secrets engine.\n</code></pre> <ul> <li> <p>Disable - This disables an existing secrets engine. When a secrets engine is disabled, all of its secrets are revoked (if they support it), and all the data stored for that engine in the physical storage layer is deleted.</p> </li> <li> <p>Move - This moves the path for an existing secrets engine. This process revokes all secrets, since secret leases are tied to the path where they were created. The configuration data stored for the engine persists through the move.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tune - This tunes global configuration for the secrets engine such as the TTLs.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Once a secrets engine is enabled, you can interact with it directly at its path according to its own API. Use vault path-help to determine the paths it responds to.</p> <p>Note that mount points cannot conflict with each other in Vault. There are two broad implications of this fact. The first is that you cannot have a mount which is prefixed with an existing mount. The second is that you cannot create a mount point that is named as a prefix of an existing mount.
