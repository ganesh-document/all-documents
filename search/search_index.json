This choice in identity solutions gives you the flexibility to use the most appropriate directory for your organization's needs.</p> <p>For example, if you mostly manage cloud-only users that run mobile devices, it may not make sense to build and run your own Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) identity solution. Instead, you could use Azure Active Directory.</p> <p></p> <p>Although the three Active Directory-based identity solutions share a common name and technology, they're designed to provide services that meet different customer demands. At a high level, these identity solutions and feature sets are:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) - Cloud-based identity and mobile device management that provides user account and authentication services for resources such as Microsoft 365, the Azure portal, or SaaS applications.</p> <ul> <li>Azure AD can be synchronized with an on-premises AD DS environment to provide a single identity to users that works natively in the cloud.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) - Enterprise-ready lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) server that provides key features such as identity and authentication, computer object management, group policy, and trusts.</p> <ul> <li>AD DS is a central component in many organizations with an on-premises IT environment and provides core user account authentication and computer management features.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure AD DS) - Provides managed domain services with a subset of fully compatible traditional AD DS features such as domain join, group policy, LDAP, and Kerberos / New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM) authentication.</p> <ul> <li>Azure AD DS integrates with Azure AD, which can synchronize with an on-premises AD DS environment.

Microsoft creates and manages the required resources.</li> <li>A self-managed domain that you create and configure using traditional resources such as virtual machines (VMs), Windows Server guest OS, and Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS). You then continue to administer these resources.</li> </ul> <p>With Azure AD DS, the core service components are deployed and maintained for you by Microsoft as a managed domain experience. You don't deploy, manage, patch, and secure the AD DS infrastructure for components like the VMs, Windows Server OS, or domain controllers (DCs).</p> <p>Azure AD DS provides a smaller subset of features to traditional self-managed AD DS environment, which reduces some of the design and management complexity. For example, there are no AD forests, domains, sites, and replication links to design and maintain.</p> <p>For applications and services that run in the cloud and need access to traditional authentication mechanisms such as Kerberos or NTLM, Azure AD DS provides a managed domain experience with a minimal amount of administrative overhead.</p> <p>When you deploy and run a self-managed AD DS environment, you must maintain all of the associated infrastructure and directory components. There's additional maintenance overhead with a self-managed AD DS environment, but you're then able to do additional tasks, such as extending the schema or create forest trusts.</p> <p>Common deployment models for a self-managed AD DS environment that provides identity to applications and services in the cloud include the following:</p> <ul> <li>Standalone cloud-only AD DS - Azure VMs are configured as domain controllers, and a separate, cloud-only AD DS environment is created. This AD DS environment doesn't integrate with an on-premises AD DS environment. A different set of credentials is used to sign in and administer VMs in the cloud.</li> <li>Resource forest deployment - Azure VMs are configured as domain controllers, and an AD DS domain that's part of an existing forest is created. A trust relationship is then configured to an on-premises AD DS environment. Other Azure VMs can domain-join this resource forest in the cloud. User authentication runs over a VPN / ExpressRoute connection to the on-premises AD DS environment.</li> <li>Extend on-premises domain to Azure - An Azure virtual network connects to an on-premises network using a VPN / ExpressRoute connection. Azure VMs connect to this Azure virtual network, which lets them domain-join to the on-premises AD DS environment.</li> </ul> <p>An alternative is to create Azure VMs and promote them as replica domain controllers from the on-premises AD DS domain. These domain controllers replicate over a VPN / ExpressRoute connection to the on-premises AD DS environment.

LDAP write support is available for objects created in the managed domain but not resources synchronized from Azure AD.</p> <p>The following features of Azure AD DS simplify deployment and management operations:</p> <ul> <li>Simplified deployment experience: Azure AD DS is enabled for your Azure AD tenant using a single wizard in the Azure portal. </li> <li>Integrated with Azure AD: User accounts, group memberships, and credentials are automatically available from your Azure AD tenant. New users, groups, or changes to attributes from your Azure AD tenant or your on-premises AD DS environment are automatically synchronized to Azure AD DS.<ul> <li>Accounts in external directories linked to your Azure AD aren't available in Azure AD DS. Credentials aren't available for those external directories, so they can't be synchronized into a managed domain.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Use your corporate credentials/passwords: Passwords for users in Azure AD DS are the same as in your Azure AD tenant. Users can use their corporate credentials to domain-join machines, sign in interactively or over a remote desktop, and authenticate against the managed domain.</li> <li>NTLM and Kerberos authentication: With support for NTLM and Kerberos authentication, you can deploy applications that rely on Windows-integrated authentication.</li> <li>High availability: Azure AD DS includes multiple domain controllers, which provide high availability for your managed domain. This high availability guarantees service uptime and resilience to failures.<ul> <li>In regions that support Azure Availability Zones, these domain controllers are distributed across zones for additional resiliency.</li> <li>Replica sets can also be used to provide geographical disaster recovery for legacy applications if an Azure region goes offline.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Some key aspects of a managed domain include the following:    - The managed domain is a stand-alone domain.

Example: A payroll manager wants to access the payroll application and is required to perform multifactor authentication to access it.</p> <p>Administrators are faced with two primary goals:</p> <ul> <li>Empower users to be productive wherever and whenever</li> <li>Protect the organization's assets</li> </ul> <p>By using Conditional Access policies, you can apply the right access controls when needed to keep your organization secure and stay out of your user\u2019s way when not needed.</p> <p></p> <p>Conditional Access policies are enforced after the first-factor authentication has been completed. Conditional Access is not intended as an organization's first line of defense for scenarios like denial-of-service (DoS) attacks but can use signals from these events to determine access.</p>"},{"location":"Cloud/Azure/AZ-500/Manage-Identity-and-Access.html#configure-conditional-access-conditions","title":"Configure conditional access conditions","text":"<p>Conditional access is a capability of Azure AD (with an Azure AD Premium license) that enables you to enforce controls on the access to apps in your environment based on specific conditions from a central location.

By using conditional access policies, you can apply the correct access controls under the required conditions.</p> <p>Conditional access comes with six conditions: user/group, cloud application, device state, location (IP range), client application, and sign-in risk.

These policies enforce different rules and effects over your resources so that those resources stay compliant with your corporate standards and service level agreements. Azure Policy meets this need by evaluating your resources for noncompliance with assigned policies. For example, you might have a policy that allows virtual machines of only a certain size in your environment. After this policy is implemented, new and existing resources are evaluated for compliance. With the right type of policy, existing resources can be brought into compliance.</p> <p>There are three main pillars in the functionalities of Azure policy.</p> <p></p> <p>The first pillar is around real-time enforcement and compliance assessment. For example, a policy would block the creation of resources that are located outside of US regions. Each policy also provides compliance assessment on all your existing resources to bring a state of compliance for each resource. The data then powers the compliance view which aggregates results across all of the applied policies. Policies can be used to ensure that resource groups are getting tagged properly and automatically inheriting those tags from the resource group down to the resources.</p> <p>The second pillar of policy is applying policies at scale by leveraging Management Groups. By assigning policy to a management group one can impact hundreds of subscriptions and all its reach resources through a single policy assignment. There also is the concept called policy initiative that allows you to group policies together so that you can view the aggregated compliance result. At the initiative level there's also a concept called exclusion where one can exclude either the child management group subscription resource group or resources from the policy assignment.</p> <p>The third pillar of your policy is remediation by leveraging a remediation policy that will automatically remediate the non-compliant resource so that your environment always stays compliant. For existing resources, they will be flagged as non-compliant but they won't automatically be changed because there can be impact to the environment. For these cases you can create a remediation task to bring these resources to compliance.

Azure AD and Role Based Access Control (RBAC) make it simple for you to carry out these goals. After you extend your on-premises Active Directory to the cloud by using Azure AD Connect, your employees can use and manage their Azure subscriptions by using their existing work identities. These Azure subscriptions automatically connect to Azure AD for SSO and access management. When you disable an on-premises Active Directory account, it automatically loses access to all Azure subscriptions connected with Azure AD.</p> <p>Additionally, synchronizing passwords to the cloud to support these checks also add resiliency during some attacks. Customers affected by (Not)Petya attacks were able to continue business operations when password hashes were synced to Azure AD (vs. near zero communications and IT services for customers affected organizations that had not synchronized passwords).</p> <p>RBAC enables fine-grained access management for Azure. Using RBAC, you can grant just the amount of access that users need to perform their jobs. For example, you can use RBAC to let one employee manage virtual machines in a subscription while another manages SQL databases within the same subscription.</p> <p>Each Azure subscription is associated with one Azure AD directory. Users, groups, and applications in that directory can manage resources in the Azure subscription. Grant access by assigning the appropriate RBAC role to users, groups, and applications at a certain scope. The scope of a role assignment can be a subscription, a resource group, or a single resource. A role assigned at a parent scope also grants access to the child scopes contained within it. For example, a user with access to a resource group can manage all the resources it contains, like websites, virtual machines, and subnets. The RBAC role that you assign dictates what resources the user, group, or application can manage within that scope.</p> <p>The following diagram depicts how the classic subscription administrator roles, RBAC roles, and Azure AD administrator roles are related at a high level. Roles assigned at a higher scope, like a subscription, are inherited by child scopes, like service instances.</p> <p></p> <pre><code>Important\n\nNote that a subscription is associated with only one Azure AD tenant. Also note that a resource group can have multiple resources but is associated with only one subscription.

Azure Policy evaluates the state by examining properties on resources that are represented in Resource Manager and properties of some Resource Providers. Azure Policy ensures that the resource state is compliant with your business rules without concern for who made the change or who has permission to make a change. Azure Policy, through the DenyAction effect, can also block specific actions on resources. Some Azure Policy resources, such as policy definitions, initiative definitions, and assignments, are visible to all users. This design enables transparency to all users and services regarding what policy rules are set in their environment.</p> <p>Azure RBAC focuses on managing user actions at different scopes. If control of an action is required based on user information, then Azure RBAC is the correct tool to use. Even if an individual has access to perform an action, if the result is a non-compliant resource, Azure Policy still blocks the create or update task.</p> <p>The combination of Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) and Azure Policy provides full-scope control in Azure.</p> <p>Azure Policy has several permissions, known as operations, in two Resource Providers:</p> <ol> <li>Microsoft.Authorization</li> <li>Microsoft.PolicyInsights</li> </ol> <p>Many built-in roles grant permission to Azure Policy resources.

Using Vault\u2019s UI, CLI, or HTTP API, access to secrets and other sensitive data can be securely stored and managed, tightly controlled (restricted), and auditable.</p> <p>A modern system requires access to a multitude of secrets, including database credentials, API keys for external services, credentials for service-oriented architecture communication, etc. It can be difficult to understand who is accessing which secrets, especially since this can be platform-specific. Adding on key rolling, secure storage, and detailed audit logs is almost impossible without a custom solution. This is where Vault steps in.</p> <p>Vault validates and authorizes clients (users, machines, apps) before providing them access to secrets or stored sensitive data.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"Security/Hashicorp-vault/Hashicorp-vault.html#how-does-vault-work","title":"How does Vault work?","text":"<p>Vault works primarily with tokens and a token is associated to the client's policy. Each policy is path-based and policy rules constrains the actions and accessibility to the paths for each client. With Vault, you can create tokens manually and assign them to your clients, or the clients can log in and obtain a token. The illustration below displays Vault's core workflow.</p> <p></p> <p>The core Vault workflow consists of four stages:</p> <ul> <li>Authenticate: Authentication in Vault is the process by which a client supplies information that Vault uses to determine if they are who they say they are. Once the client is authenticated against an auth method, a token is generated and associated to a policy.</li> <li>Validation: Vault validates the client against third-party trusted sources, such as Github, LDAP, AppRole, and more.</li> <li>Authorize: A client is matched against the Vault security policy. This policy is a set of rules defining which API endpoints a client has access to with its Vault token. Policies provide a declarative way to grant or forbid access to certain paths and operations in Vault.</li> <li>Access: Vault grants access to secrets, keys, and encryption capabilities by issuing a token based on policies associated with the client\u2019s identity. The client can then use their Vault token for future operations.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Security/Hashicorp-vault/Hashicorp-vault.html#why-vault","title":"Why Vault?","text":"<p>Most enterprises today have credentials sprawled across their organizations. Passwords, API keys, and credentials are stored in plain text, app source code, config files, and other locations. Because these credentials live everywhere, the sprawl can make it difficult and daunting to really know who has access and authorization to what. Having credentials in plain text also increases the potential for malicious attacks, both by internal and external attackers.</p> <p>Vault was designed with these challenges in mind. Vault takes all of these credentials and centralizes them so that they are defined in one location, which reduces unwanted exposure to credentials. But Vault takes it a few steps further by making sure users, apps, and systems are authenticated and explicitly authorized to access resources, while also providing an audit trail that captures and preserves a history of clients' actions.</p> <p>The key features of Vault are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Secure Secret Storage: Arbitrary key/value secrets can be stored in Vault. Vault encrypts these secrets prior to writing them to persistent storage, so gaining access to the raw storage isn't enough to access your secrets. Vault can write to disk, Consul, and more.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dynamic Secrets: Vault can generate secrets on-demand for some systems, such as AWS or SQL databases. For example, when an application needs to access an S3 bucket, it asks Vault for credentials, and Vault will generate an AWS keypair with valid permissions on demand. After creating these dynamic secrets, Vault will also automatically revoke them after the lease is up.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data Encryption: Vault can encrypt and decrypt data without storing it. This allows security teams to define encryption parameters and developers to store encrypted data in a location such as a SQL database without having to design their own encryption methods.</p> </li> <li> <p>Leasing and Renewal: All secrets in Vault have a lease associated with them. At the end of the lease, Vault will automatically revoke that secret. Clients are able to renew leases via built-in renew APIs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Revocation: Vault has built-in support for secret revocation. Vault can revoke not only single secrets, but a tree of secrets, for example all secrets read by a specific user, or all secrets of a particular type. Revocation assists in key rolling as well as locking down systems in the case of an intrusion.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Security/Hashicorp-vault/Hashicorp-vault.html#what-is-hcp-vault","title":"What is HCP Vault?","text":"<p>HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) Vault is a hosted version of Vault, which is operated by HashiCorp to allow organizations to get up and running quickly.
