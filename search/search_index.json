This design should consider how likely the primary control is to fail, the potential organizational risk if it does, and the effectiveness of the additional control (especially in the likely cases that would cause the primary control to fail).</p> <p>During this module, we will explore the defense-in-depth design of Azure services and capabilities to help you securely manage and monitor your cloud data and infrastructure as a managed service. Microsoft designs and operates its cloud services with security at the core and provides you built-in controls and tools to meet your security needs. In addition, with Machine Learning (ML) and Microsoft's significant investments in cyber defense you can benefit from unique intelligence and proactive measures to protect you from threats. Azure offers unified security management and advanced threat protection for your resources whether they're in the cloud, your data center, or both. Each Service in Azure is built with security in mind from the ground up to host your infrastructure apps and data. All services are designed and operated to support multiple layers of defense, spanning your data apps, virtual machines, network perimeter-related policies, and physical security within our data centers. Including how the data sensors and systems that run Azure are architected and operated to the controls you can apply as part of your defense in-depth security management. An example strategy is illustrated in the following image.</p> <p></p> <p>As more of a company\u2019s digital resources reside outside the corporate network, in the cloud and on personal devices, it becomes obvious that a perimeter only based security, i.e. firewalls, DMZ, VNets, are no longer adequate.

In contrast to network access controls that are based on elements such as source and destination IP address, protocols, and port numbers, Zero Trust enforces and validates access control at \u201caccess time\u201d.

A VNet is a logical isolation of the Azure cloud network dedicated to your subscription.

The link between Azure and your site uses a dedicated connection that does not go over the public Internet.

A virtual network is scoped to a single Azure region. An Azure region is a set of datacenters deployed within a latency-defined perimeter and connected through a dedicated regional low-latency network.</p> <p>Virtual networks are made up of subnets. A subnet is a range of IP addresses within your virtual network. Subnets, like virtual networks, are scoped to a single Azure region. You can implement multiple virtual networks within each Azure subscription and Azure region. Each virtual network is isolated from other virtual networks. For each virtual network you can:</p> <ul> <li>Specify a custom private IP address space using public and private addresses. Azure assigns resources in a virtual network a private IP address from the address space that you assign.</li> <li>Segment the virtual network into one or more subnets and allocate a portion of the virtual network's address space to each subnet.</li> <li>Use Azure-provided name resolution, or specify your own DNS server, for use by resources in a virtual network.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Cloud/Azure/AZ-500/Implement-platform-protection.html#ip-addresses","title":"IP addresses","text":"<p>VMs, Azure load balancers, and application gateways in a single virtual network require unique Internet Protocol (IP) addresses the same way that clients in an on-premises subnet do. This enables these resources to communicate with each other. A virtual network uses two types of IP addresses:</p> <ul> <li>Private - A private IP address is dynamically or statically allocated to a VM from the defined scope of IP addresses in the virtual network. VMs use these addresses to communicate with other VMs in the same or connected virtual networks through a gateway / Azure ExpressRoute connection. These private IP addresses, or non-routable IP addresses, conform to RFC 1918.</li> <li>Public - Public IP addresses, which allow Azure resources to communicate with external clients, are assigned directly at the virtual network adapter of the VM or to the load balancer. Public IP address can also be added to Azure-only virtual networks. All IP blocks in the virtual network will be routable only within the customer's network, and they won't be reachable from outside. Virtual network packets travel through the high-speed Azure backplane.</li> </ul> <p>You can control the dynamic IP addresses assigned to VMs and cloud services within an Azure virtual network by specifying an IP addressing scheme.

If the attack originates from one location, it is called a DoS. If the attack originates from multiple networks and systems, it is called distributed denial of service (DDoS).</p> <p>Before learning more about DDoS, you need to know what botnets are. Botnets are collections of internet-connected systems that an individual controls and uses without their owners\u2019 knowledge. Botnet owners use them to perform various actions of their choosing.</p> <p>Often, they use them for spamming, data storage, DDoS, or various other actions that are up to the person in control of the botnet. In the past, botnets were made up just of compromised computers, but now, botnets are also made up of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Malicious hackers can get these poorly secured security cameras, digital video recorders, thermostats, and other internet-connected devices under their control.</p> <p>So, DDoS is a collection of attack types aimed at disrupting the availability of a target. These attacks involve a coordinated effort that uses multiple internet-connected systems to launch many network requests against DNS, web services, email, and more. Pretty much any application that the malicious hacker can access might become the target of a DDoS. The malicious hacker\u2019s goal is to overwhelm system resources on targeted servers so they can no longer process legitimate traffic, effectively making the system inaccessible.</p> <p>A DDoS generally involves many systems sending traffic to targets as part of a botnet. In most cases, the owners of the systems in a botnet don\u2019t know that their devices are compromised and participating in an attack. Botnets are becoming a bigger problem than before because of the increasing numbers of connected devices.</p> <p>Designing and building for DDoS resiliency requires planning and designing for a variety of failure modes.

By default, Azure Firewall blocks traffic.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"Cloud/Azure/AZ-500/Implement-platform-protection.html#the-azure-firewall-features-include","title":"The Azure firewall features include","text":"<ul> <li>Built-in high availability - Because high availability is built in, no additional load balancers are required and there\u2019s nothing you need to configure.</li> <li>Unrestricted cloud scalability - Azure Firewall can scale up as much as you need, to accommodate changing network traffic flows so you don't need to budget for your peak traffic.</li> <li>Application Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) filtering rules - You can limit outbound HTTP/S traffic to a specified list of FQDNs, including wild cards. This feature does not require SSL termination.</li> <li>Network traffic filtering rules - You can centrally create allow or deny network filtering rules by source and destination IP address, port, and protocol. Azure Firewall is fully stateful, so it can distinguish legitimate packets for different types of connections. Rules are enforced and logged across multiple subscriptions and virtual networks.</li> <li>Qualified domain tags - Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) tags make it easier for you to allow well known Azure service network traffic through your firewall. For example, say you want to allow Windows Update network traffic through your firewall. You create an application rule and include the Windows Update tag. Now network traffic from Windows Update can flow through your firewall.</li> <li>Outbound Source Network Address Translation (OSNAT) support - All outbound virtual network traffic IP addresses are translated to the Azure Firewall public IP. You can identify and allow traffic originating from your virtual network to remote internet destinations.</li> <li>Inbound Destination Network Address Translation (DNAT) support - Inbound network traffic to your firewall public IP address is translated and filtered to the private IP addresses on your virtual networks.    -Azure Monitor logging- All events are integrated with Azure Monitor, allowing you to archive logs to a storage account, stream events to your Event Hub, or send them to Azure Monitor logs.</li> </ul> <p>Grouping the features above into logical groups reveals that Azure Firewall has three rule types: NAT rules, network rules, and application rules. The application order precedence for the rules are that network rules are applied first, then application rules. Rules are terminating, which means if a match is found in network rules, then application rules are not processed. If there\u2019s no network rule match, and if the packet protocol is HTTP/HTTPS, the packet is then evaluated by the application rules. If no match continues to be found, then the packet is evaluated against the infrastructure rule collection. If there\u2019s still no match, then the packet is denied by default.</p> <p>NAT rules</p> <p>You can configure inbound connectivity by configuring Destination Network Address Translation (DNAT) as described in: Filter inbound traffic with Azure Firewall DNAT using the Azure portal. DNAT rules are applied first. If a match is found, an implicit corresponding network rule to allow the translated traffic is added. You can override this behavior by explicitly adding a network rule collection with deny rules that match the translated traffic. No application rules are applied for these connections.</p> <p>Firewall rules to secure Azure Storage</p> <p>Azure Storage provides a layered security model, which enables you to secure your storage accounts to a specific set of supported networks. When network rules are configured, only applications requesting data from over the specified set of networks can access a storage account.</p> <p>An application that accesses a storage account when network rules are in effect requires proper authorization on the request. Authorization is supported with Azure AD credentials for blobs and queues, a valid account access key, or a SAS token.</p> <p>By default, storage accounts accept connections from clients on any network. To limit access to selected networks, you must first change the default action. Making changes to network rules can impact your applications' ability to connect to Azure Storage. Setting the default network rule to Deny blocks all access to the data unless specific network rules that grant access are also applied. Be sure to grant access to any allowed networks using network rules before you change the default rule to deny access.</p> <p>Grant access from a virtual network</p> <p>You can configure storage accounts to allow access only from specific VNets.</p> <p>You enable a service endpoint for Azure Storage within the VNet. This endpoint gives traffic an optimal route to the Azure Storage service. The identities of the virtual network and the subnet are also transmitted with each request. Administrators can then configure network rules for the storage account that allow requests to be received from specific subnets in the VNet. Clients granted access via these network rules must continue to meet the authorization requirements of the storage account to access the data.</p> <p>Each storage account supports up to 100 virtual network rules, which could be combined with IP network rules.</p> <p>Controlling outbound and inbound network access is an important part of an overall network security plan. Network traffic is subjected to the configured firewall rules when you route your network traffic to the firewall as the default gateway.</p>"},{"location":"Cloud/Azure/AZ-500/Implement-platform-protection.html#deploy-an-azure-firewall-implementation","title":"Deploy an Azure Firewall implementation","text":"<p>Controlling outbound network access is an important part of an overall network security plan. For example, you may want to limit access to web sites. Or, you may want to limit the outbound IP addresses and ports that can be accessed.</p> <p>One way you can control outbound network access from an Azure subnet is with Azure Firewall. With Azure Firewall, you can configure:</p> <ul> <li>Application rules that define fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) that can be accessed from a subnet.</li> <li>Network rules that define source address, protocol, destination port, and destination address.</li> </ul> <p>Network traffic is subjected to the configured firewall rules when you route your network traffic to the firewall as the subnet default gateway.</p> <p></p> <p>Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) tag</p> <p>An FQDN tag represents a group of fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) associated with well known Microsoft services. You can use an FQDN tag in application rules to allow the required outbound network traffic through your firewall.</p> <p>For example, to manually allow Windows Update network traffic through your firewall, you need to create multiple application rules per the Microsoft documentation. Using FQDN tags, you can create an application rule, include the Windows Updates tag, and now network traffic to Microsoft Windows Update endpoints can flow through your firewall.</p> <p>Infrastructure qualified domain names</p> <p>Azure Firewall includes a built-in rule collection for infrastructure FQDNs that are allowed by default. These FQDNs are specific for the platform and can't be used for other purposes.</p> <p>The following services are included in the built-in rule collection:</p> <ul> <li>Compute access to storage Platform Image Repository (PIR)</li> <li>Managed disks status storage access</li> <li>Azure Diagnostics and Logging (MDS)</li> </ul> <p>Logs and metrics</p> <p>You can monitor Azure Firewall using firewall logs. You can also use activity logs to audit operations on Azure Firewall resources.</p> <p>You can access some of these logs through the portal. Logs can be sent to Azure Monitor logs, Storage, and Event Hubs and analyzed in Azure Monitor logs or by different tools such as Excel and Power BI.</p> <p>Metrics are lightweight and can support near real-time scenarios making them useful for alerting and fast issue detection.</p> <p>Threat intelligence-based filtering</p> <p>Threat intelligence-based filtering can be enabled for your firewall to alert and deny traffic from/to known malicious IP addresses and domains. The IP addresses and domains are sourced from the Microsoft Threat Intelligence feed. Intelligent Security Graph powers Microsoft threat intelligence and is used by multiple services including Microsoft Defender for Cloud. If you've enabled threat intelligence-based filtering, the associated rules are processed before any of the NAT rules, network rules, or application rules.</p> <p>You can choose to just log an alert when a rule is triggered, or you can choose alert and deny mode. By default, threat intelligence-based filtering is enabled in alert mode.</p> <p>Rule processing logic You can configure NAT rules, network rules, and applications rules on Azure Firewall. Rule collections are processed according to the rule type in priority order, lower numbers to higher numbers from 100 to 65,000. A rule collection name can have only letters, numbers, underscores, periods, or hyphens. It must begin with a letter or number, and end with a letter, number or underscore. The maximum name length is 80 characters.</p> <p>It's best to initially space your rule collection priority numbers in 100 increments (100, 200, 300, and so on) so you have room to add more rule collections if needed.</p> <p>Service tags</p> <p>A service tag represents a group of IP address prefixes to help minimize complexity for security rule creation. You cannot create your own service tag, nor specify which IP addresses are included within a tag. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag, and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.</p> <p>Azure Firewall service tags can be used in the network rules destination field. You can use them in place of specific IP addresses.</p> <p>Remote work support</p> <p>VDI</p> <p>Work from home policies requires many IT organizations to address fundamental changes in capacity, network, security, and governance. Employees aren't protected by the layered security policies associated with on-premises services while working from home. Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) deployments on Azure can help organizations rapidly respond to this changing environment. However, you need a way to protect inbound/outbound Internet access to and from these VDI deployments. You can use Azure Firewall DNAT rules along with its threat intelligence-based filtering capabilities to protect your VDI deployments.</p> <p>Virtual Desktop support</p> <p>Azure Virtual Desktop is a comprehensive desktop and app virtualization service running in Azure. It\u2019s the only virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) that delivers simplified management, multi-session Windows 10, optimizations for Microsoft 365 ProPlus, and support for Remote Desktop Services (RDS) environments. You can deploy and scale your Windows desktops and apps on Azure in minutes and get built-in security and compliance features. Windows Virtual Desktop doesn't require you to open any inbound access to your virtual network.

This is called Internet tunneling. Site-to-site (S2S) VPNs use tunnels to encapsulate data packets within normal IP packets for forwarding over IP-based networks, using encryption to ensure privacy and authentication to ensure integrity of data.</p> <p>Forced tunneling lets you redirect, or force, all internet-bound traffic back to your on-premises location via a site-to-site VPN tunnel for inspection and auditing. This is a critical security requirement for most enterprise IT policies. Without forced tunneling, internet-bound traffic from your VMs in Azure always traverses from the Azure network infrastructure directly to the internet\u2014without the option to allow you to inspect or audit the traffic. Unauthorized internet access potentially leads to information disclosure or other types of security breaches.</p> <p>As stated earlier, Azure currently works with two deployment models: The Resource Manager deployment model and the classic deployment model. The two models aren\u2019t completely compatible with each other. The following exercise goes through configuring tunneling for virtual networks that were created via the Resource Manager deployment model.</p> <p>The following figure depicts how forced tunneling works.</p> <p></p> <p>In the preceding figure, the front-end subnet doesn\u2019t use forced tunneling. The workloads in the front-end subnet can continue to accept and respond to customer requests that come directly from the internet. The mid-tier and back-end subnets use forced tunneling. Any outbound connections from these two subnets to the internet are forced back to an on-premises site via one of the S2S VPN tunnels.</p> <p>This allows you to restrict and inspect internet access from your VMs or cloud services in Azure while continuing to enable your multi-tier service architecture. If no internet-facing workloads exist in your VMs, you can also apply forced tunneling to the entire virtual network.</p> <p>You configure forced tunneling in Azure via virtual network User Defined Routes (UDR). Redirecting traffic to an on-premises site is expressed as a default route to the Azure VPN gateway. This example uses UDRs to create a routing table to first add a default route and then associate the routing table with your virtual network subnets to enable forced tunneling on those subnets.</p>"},{"location":"Cloud/Azure/AZ-500/Implement-platform-protection.html#create-user-defined-routes-and-network-virtual-appliances","title":"Create User Defined Routes and Network Virtual Appliances","text":"<p>User Defined Routes</p> <p>A User Defined Routes (UDR) is a custom route in Azure that overrides Azure's default system routes or adds routes to a subnet's route table. In Azure, you create a route table and then associate that route table with zero or more virtual network subnets. Each subnet can have zero or one route table associated with it. If you create a route table and associate it to a subnet, Azure either combines its routes with the default routes that Azure adds to a subnet or overrides those default routes.</p> <p>In this diagram UDRs are used to direct traffic from the Gateway subnet and the Web tier to the Network Virtual Appliance (NVA).</p> <p></p> <p>Network Virtual Appliances</p> <p>You can deploy an NVA to a perimeter network in many architectures. In the previous diagram, the NVA helps provide a secure network boundary by checking all inbound and outbound network traffic and then passing only the traffic that meets the network security rules. However, the fact that all network traffic passes through the NVA means that the NVA is a single point of failure in the network. If the NVA fails, no other path will exist for network traffic, and all the back-end subnets will become unavailable.</p> <p>To make an NVA highly available, deploy more than one NVA into an availability set.</p> <p>The following figure shows a high-availability architecture that implements an ingress perimeter network behind an internet-facing load balancer. This architecture is designed to provide connectivity to Azure workloads for layer 7 traffic, such as HTTP or HTTPS traffic.</p> <p></p> <p>The benefit of this architecture is that all NVAs are active, and if one fails, the load balancer directs network traffic to the other NVA. Both NVAs route traffic to the internal load balancer, so if one NVA is active, traffic will continue to flow. The NVAs are required to terminate SSL traffic intended for the web tier VMs. These NVAs can\u2019t be extended to handle on-premises traffic, because on-premises traffic requires another dedicated set of NVAs with their own network.</p> <p>UDRs and NSGs help provide layer 3 and layer 4 (of the OSI model) security.

Network connectivity is possible between resources located in Azure, between on-premises and Azure hosted resources, and to and from the internet and Azure.</p> <p>Scenario A security engineer uses network security features to restrict, monitor, and manage network traffic once it reaches your Azure network; you will work on such tasks as:</p> <ul> <li>Setup network security groups and application security groups.</li> <li>Deploy Service Endpoints and Private Links.</li> <li>Configure Front Door and ExpressRoute.</li> </ul> <p>Skills measured Securing the Azure platform your cloud solutions run on is a part of Exam AZ-500: Microsoft Azure Security Engineer.</p> <p>Implement platform protection (15-20%)</p> <p>Implement advanced network security    - Secure the connectivity of virtual networks (VPN authentication, Express Route encryption)    - Configure Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Application Security Groups (ASGs)    - Configure Azure Front Door service as an Application Gateway    - Configure a Web Application Firewall (WAF) on Azure Application Gateway    - Implement Service Endpoints</p> <p>Explore Network Security Groups (NSG) Network traffic can be filtered to and from Azure resources in an Azure virtual network with a network security group. A network security group contains security rules that allow or deny inbound network traffic to, or outbound network traffic from, several types of Azure resources. For each rule, you can specify source and destination, port, and protocol.</p> <p>VMs that you create via the Resource Manager deployment model can have direct connectivity to the internet by using a public IP address that is directly assigned to the VMs. Only the host firewall configured inside the VMs helps protect these VMs from the internet.</p> <p>VMs that you create by using the classic deployment model communicate with internet resources through the cloud service that is assigned the public IP address, which is also known as the VIP. VMs that reside inside the cloud service share that VIP and establish communication with internet resources by using endpoints. If you remove the VM endpoints that map the public port and public IP address of the cloud service to the private port and private IP address of the VM, the VM becomes unreachable from the internet via the public IP address.</p> <p>Network Security Groups (NSGs) help provide advanced security for the VMs you create via either deployment model (Resource Manager or classic). NSGs control inbound and outbound traffic passing through a network adapter (in the Resource Manager deployment model), a VM (in the classic deployment model), or a subnet (in both deployment models).</p> <p>Network Security Group rules NSGs contain rules that specify whether traffic will be approved or denied. Each rule is based on a source IP address, a source port, a destination IP address, and a destination port. Based on whether the traffic matches this combination, the rule either allows or denies the traffic. Each rule consists of the following properties:</p> <ul> <li>Name. This is a unique identifier for the rule.</li> <li>Direction. This specifies whether the traffic is inbound or outbound.</li> <li>Priority. If multiple rules match the traffic, rules with a higher priority apply.</li> <li>Access. This specifies whether the traffic is allowed or denied.</li> <li>Source IP address prefix. This prefix identifies where the traffic originated from. It can be based on a single IP address; a range of IP addresses in Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR) notation; or the asterisk (*), which is a wildcard that matches all possible IP addresses.</li> <li>Source port range. This specifies source ports by using either a single port number from 1 through 65,535; a range of ports (for example, 200\u2013400); or the asterisk (*) to denote all possible ports.</li> <li>Destination IP address prefix. This identifies the traffic destination based on a single IP address, a range of IP addresses in CIDR notation, or the asterisk (*) to match all possible IP addresses.</li> <li>Destination port range. This specifies destination ports by using either a single port number from 1 through 65,535; a range of ports (for example, 200\u2013400); or the asterisk (*) to denote all possible ports.</li> <li>Protocol. This specifies a protocol that matches the rule. It can be UDP, TCP, or the asterisk (*).</li> </ul> <p>Custom Network Security Group rules Predefined default rules exist for inbound and outbound traffic. You can\u2019t delete these rules, but you can override them, because they have the lowest priority. The default rules allow all inbound and outbound traffic within a virtual network, allow outbound traffic towards the internet, and allow inbound traffic to an Azure load balancer. A default rule with the lowest priority also exists in both the inbound and outbound sets of rules that denies all network communication.</p> <p>When you create a custom rule, you can use default tags in the source and destination IP address prefixes to specify predefined categories of IP addresses. These default tags are:</p> <ul> <li>Internet. This tag represents internet IP addresses.</li> <li>Virtual_network. This tag identifies all IP addresses that the IP range for the virtual network defines. It also includes IP address ranges from on-premises networks when they are defined as local network to virtual network.</li> <li>Azure_loadbalancer. This tag specifies the default Azure load balancer destination.</li> </ul> <p>Planning Network Security Groups You can design NSGs to isolate virtual networks in security zones, like the model used by on-premises infrastructure does. You can apply NSGs to subnets, which allows you to create protected screened subnets, or DMZs, that can restrict traffic flow to all the machines residing within that subnet. With the classic deployment model, you can also assign NSGs to individual computers to control traffic that is both destined for and leaving the VM. With the Resource Manager deployment model, you can assign NSGs to a network adapter so that NSG rules control only the traffic that flows through that network adapter. If the VM has multiple network adapters, NSG rules won\u2019t automatically be applied to traffic that is designated for other network adapters.</p> <p>You create NSGs as resources in a resource group, but you can share them with other resource groups in your subscription.</p> <p>Deploy a Network Security Groups implementation When implementing NSGs, these are the limits to keep in mind:</p> <ul> <li>By default, you can create 100 NSGs per region per subscription. You can raise this limit to 400 by contacting Azure support.</li> <li>You can apply only one NSG to a VM, subnet, or network adapter.</li> <li>By default, you can have up to 200 rules in a single NSG. You can raise this limit to 500 by contacting Azure support.</li> <li>You can apply an NSG to multiple resources.</li> </ul> <p>An individual subnet can have zero, or one, associated NSG. An individual network interface can also have zero, or one, associated NSG. So, you can effectively have dual traffic restriction for a virtual machine by associating an NSG first to a subnet, and then another NSG to the VM's network interface. The application of NSG rules in this case depends on the direction of traffic and priority of applied security rules.</p> <p>Consider a simple example with one virtual machine as follows:</p> <ul> <li>The virtual machine is placed inside the Contoso Subnet.</li> <li>Contoso Subnet is associated with Subnet NSG.</li> <li>The VM network interface is additionally associated with VM NSG.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>In this example, for inbound traffic, the Subnet NSG is evaluated first. Any traffic allowed through Subnet NSG is then evaluated by VM NSG. The reverse is applicable for outbound traffic, with VM NSG being evaluated first. Any traffic allowed through VM NSG is then evaluated by Subnet NSG.</p> <p>This allows for granular security rule application. For example, you might want to allow inbound internet access to a few application VMs (such as frontend VMs) under a subnet but restrict inbound internet access to other VMs (such as database and other backend VMs). In this case you can have a more lenient rule on the Subnet NSG, allowing internet traffic, and restrict access to specific VMs by denying access on VM NSG. The same can be applied for outbound traffic.</p> <p>To help secure and protect your Azure resources, make sure NSG planning is standard operating procedure (SOP) for your deployments.</p> <p>How traffic is evaluated Several resources from Azure services can be deployed into an Azure virtual network. You can associate zero, or one, network security group to each virtual network subnet and network interface in a virtual machine. The same network security group can be associated to as many subnets and network interfaces as you choose.</p> <p>The following picture illustrates different scenarios for how network security groups might be deployed to allow network traffic to and from the internet over TCP port 80:</p> <p></p> <p>Reference the above diagram, along with the following text, to understand how Azure processes inbound and outbound rules for network security groups:</p> <p>Inbound traffic</p> <p>For inbound traffic, Azure processes the rules in a network security group associated to a subnet first, if there is one, and then the rules in a network security group associated to the network interface, if there is one.</p> <ul> <li>VM1: The security rules in NSG1 are processed, since it is associated to Subnet1 and VM1 is in Subnet1. Unless you've created a rule that allows port 80 inbound, the traffic is denied by the DenyAllInbound default security rule, and never evaluated by NSG2, since NSG2 is associated to the network interface. If NSG1 has a security rule that allows port 80, the traffic is then processed by NSG2. To allow port 80 to the virtual machine, both NSG1 and NSG2 must have a rule that allows port 80 from the internet.</li> <li>VM2: The rules in NSG1 are processed because VM2 is also in Subnet1. Since VM2 does not have a network security group associated to its network interface, it receives all traffic allowed through NSG1 or is denied all traffic denied by NSG1. Traffic is either allowed or denied to all resources in the same subnet when a network security group is associated to a subnet.</li> <li>VM3: Since there is no network security group associated to Subnet2, traffic is allowed into the subnet and processed by NSG2, because NSG2 is associated to the network interface attached to VM3.</li> <li>VM4: Traffic is allowed to VM4, because a network security group isn't associated to Subnet3, or the network interface in the virtual machine. All network traffic is allowed through a subnet and network interface if they don't have a network security group associated to them.</li> </ul> <p>Outbound traffic</p> <p>For outbound traffic, Azure processes the rules in a network security group associated to a network interface first, if there is one, and then the rules in a network security group associated to the subnet, if there is one.</p> <ul> <li>VM1: The security rules in NSG2 are processed. Unless you create a security rule that denies port 80 outbound to the internet, the traffic is allowed by the AllowInternetOutbound default security rule in both NSG1 and NSG2. If NSG2 has a security rule that denies port 80, the traffic is denied, and never evaluated by NSG1. To deny port 80 from the virtual machine, either, or both of the network security groups must have a rule that denies port 80 to the internet.</li> <li>VM2: All traffic is sent through the network interface to the subnet, since the network interface attached to VM2 does not have a network security group associated to it. The rules in NSG1 are processed.</li> <li>VM3: If NSG2 has a security rule that denies port 80, the traffic is denied. If NSG2 has a security rule that allows port 80, then port 80 is allowed outbound to the internet, since a network security group is not associated to Subnet2.</li> <li>VM4: All network traffic is allowed from VM4, because a network security group isn't associated to the network interface attached to the virtual machine, or to Subnet3.</li> </ul> <p>Intra-subnet traffic It's important to note that security rules in an NSG associated to a subnet can affect connectivity between VM's within it. For example, if a rule is added to NSG1 which denies all inbound and outbound traffic, VM1 and VM2 will no longer be able to communicate with each other. Another rule would have to be added specifically to allow this.</p> <p>General guidelines Unless you have a specific reason to, we recommended that you associate a network security group to a subnet, or a network interface, but not both. Since rules in a network security group associated to a subnet can conflict with rules in a network security group associated to a network interface, you can have unexpected communication problems that require troubleshooting.</p> <p>Create Application Security Groups</p> <p>In this topic we look at Application Security Groups (ASGs), which are built on network security groups. A quick review of Security groups reminds us that you can filter network traffic to and from Azure resources in an Azure virtual network with a network security group. A network security group contains security rules that allow or deny inbound network traffic to, or outbound network traffic from, several types of Azure resources.</p> <p>For each rule, you can specify source and destination, port, and protocol. You can enable network security group flow logs to analyze network traffic to and from resources that have an associated network security group.</p> <p>Application security groups ASGs enable you to configure network security as a natural extension of an application's structure. You then can group VMs and define network security policies based on those groups.</p> <p>You also can reuse your security policy at scale without manual maintenance of explicit IP addresses. The platform manages the complexity of explicit IP addresses and multiple rule sets, allowing you to focus on your business logic. Consider the following illustration.</p> <p></p> <p>In the illustration, NIC1 and NIC2 are members of the AsgWeb ASG. NIC3 is a member of the AsgLogic ASG. NIC4 is a member of the AsgDb ASG. Though each network interface in this example is a member of only one ASG, a network interface can be a member of multiple ASGs, up to the Azure limits. None of the network interfaces have an associated network security group. NSG1 is associated to both subnets and contains the following rules:</p> <ul> <li>Allow-HTTP-Inbound-Internet</li> <li>Deny-Database-All</li> <li>Allow-Database-BusinessLogic</li> </ul> <p>The rules that specify an ASG as the source or destination are only applied to the network interfaces that are members of the ASG. If the network interface is not a member of an ASG, the rule is not applied to the network interface even though the network security group is associated to the subnet.</p> <p>Application security groups have the following constraints</p> <ul> <li>There are limits to the number of ASGs you can have in a subscription, in addition to other limits related to ASGs.</li> <li>You can specify one ASG as the source and destination in a security rule. You cannot specify multiple ASGs in the source or destination.</li> <li>All network interfaces assigned to an ASG must exist in the same virtual network that the first network interface assigned to the ASG is in. For example, if the first network interface assigned to an ASG named AsgWeb is in the virtual network named VNet1, then all subsequent network interfaces assigned to ASGWeb must exist in VNet1. You cannot add network interfaces from different virtual networks to the same ASG.</li> <li>If you specify an ASG as the source and destination in a security rule, the network interfaces in both ASGs must exist in the same virtual network. For example, if AsgLogic contained network interfaces from VNet1, and AsgDb contained network interfaces from VNet2, you could not assign AsgLogic as the source and AsgDb as the destination in a rule. All network interfaces for both the source and destination ASGs need to exist in the same virtual network.</li> </ul> <p>Summary Application Security Groups along with NSGs, have brought multiple benefits on the network security area:</p> <ul> <li>A single management experience</li> <li>Increased limits on multiple dimensions</li> <li>A great level of simplification</li> <li>A seamless integration with your architecture</li> </ul> <p>Enable service endpoints</p> <p>A virtual network service endpoint provides the identity of your virtual network to the Azure service. Once service endpoints are enabled in your virtual network, you can secure Azure service resources to your virtual network by adding a virtual network rule to the resources.</p> <p>Today, Azure service traffic from a virtual network uses public IP addresses as source IP addresses. With service endpoints, service traffic switches to use virtual network private addresses as the source IP addresses when accessing the Azure service from a virtual network. This switch allows you to access the services without the need for reserved, public IP addresses used in IP firewalls.</p> <p>A common usage case for service endpoints is a virtual machine accessing storage. The storage account restricts access to the virtual machines private IP address.</p> <p></p> <p>Why use a service endpoint?</p> <ul> <li>Improved security for your Azure service resources. VNet private address space can be overlapping and so, cannot be used to uniquely identify traffic originating from your VNet. Service endpoints provide the ability to secure Azure service resources to your virtual network, by extending VNet identity to the service. Once service endpoints are enabled in your virtual network, you can secure Azure service resources to your virtual network by adding a virtual network rule to the resources. This provides improved security by fully removing public Internet access to resources, and allowing traffic only from your virtual network.</li> <li>Optimal routing for Azure service traffic from your virtual network. Today, any routes in your virtual network that force Internet traffic to your premises and/or virtual appliances, known as forced-tunneling, also force Azure service traffic to take the same route as the Internet traffic. Service endpoints provide optimal routing for Azure traffic.</li> <li>Endpoints always take service traffic directly from your virtual network to the service on the Microsoft Azure backbone network. Keeping traffic on the Azure backbone network allows you to continue auditing and monitoring outbound Internet traffic from your virtual networks, through forced-tunneling, without impacting service traffic.</li> <li>Simple to set up with less management overhead. You no longer need reserved, public IP addresses in your virtual networks to secure Azure resources through IP firewall. There are no NAT or gateway devices required to set up the service endpoints. Service endpoints are configured through a simple click on a subnet. There is no additional overhead to maintaining the endpoints.</li> </ul> <pre><code>Important:\n\nWith service endpoints, the source IP addresses of the virtual machines in the subnet for service traffic switches from using public IPv4 addresses to using private IPv4 addresses. Existing Azure service firewall rules using Azure public IP addresses will stop working with this switch. Please ensure Azure service firewall rules allow for this switch before setting up service endpoints. You may also experience temporary interruption to service traffic from this subnet while configuring service endpoints.\n</code></pre> <p>Configure service endpoint services</p> <p>Service endpoints would provide benefits in the following Scenarios.</p> <p>Scenarios</p> <ul> <li>Peered, connected, or multiple virtual networks: To secure Azure services to multiple subnets within a virtual network or across multiple virtual networks, you can enable service endpoints on each of the subnets independently, and secure Azure service resources to all of the subnets.</li> <li>Filtering outbound traffic from a virtual network to Azure services: If you want to inspect or filter the traffic sent to an Azure service from a virtual network, you can deploy a network virtual appliance within the virtual network. You can then apply service endpoints to the subnet where the network virtual appliance is deployed, and secure Azure service resources only to this subnet. This scenario might be helpful if you want use network virtual appliance filtering to restrict Azure service access from your virtual network only to specific Azure resources.</li> <li>Securing Azure resources to services deployed directly into virtual networks: You can directly deploy various Azure services into specific subnets in a virtual network. You can secure Azure service resources to managed service subnets by setting up a service endpoint on the managed service subnet.</li> <li>Disk traffic from an Azure virtual machine: Virtual Machine Disk traffic for managed and unmanaged disks isn't affected by service endpoints routing changes for Azure Storage. This traffic includes diskIO as well as mount and unmount. You can limit REST access to page blobs to select networks through service endpoints and Azure Storage network rules.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Deploy private links</p> <p>Azure Private Link works on an approval call flow model wherein the Private Link service consumer can request a connection to the service provider for consuming the service. The service provider can then decide whether to allow the consumer to connect or not. Azure Private Link enables the service providers to manage the private endpoint connection on their resources</p> <p></p> <p>There are two connection approval methods that a Private Link service consumer can choose from:</p> <ul> <li>Automatic: If the service consumer has RBAC permissions on the service provider resource, the consumer can choose the automatic approval method. In this case, when the request reaches the service provider resource, no action is required from the service provider and the connection is automatically approved.</li> <li>Manual: On the contrary, if the service consumer doesn\u2019t have RBAC permissions on the service provider resource, the consumer can choose the manual approval method. In this case, the connection request appears on the service resources as Pending. The service provider has to manually approve the request before connections can be established. In manual cases, service consumer can also specify a message with the request to provide more context to the service provider.</li> </ul> <p>The service provider has following options to choose from for all Private Endpoint connections:</p> <ul> <li>Approved</li> <li>Reject</li> <li>Remove</li> </ul> <p>Manage private endpoint connections on Azure PaaS resources</p> <p>Portal is the preferred method for managing private endpoint connections on Azure PaaS resources.</p> <p>Implement an Azure application gateway</p> <p>Azure Application Gateway is a web traffic load balancer that enables you to manage traffic to your web applications. Traditional load balancers operate at the transport layer (OSI layer 4 - TCP and UDP) and route traffic based on the source IP address and port to a destination IP address and port.</p> <p>Application Gateway can make routing decisions based on additional attributes of an HTTP request, for example, URI path or host headers. For example, you can route traffic based on the incoming URL. So if /images are in the incoming URL, you can route traffic to a specific set of servers (known as a pool) configured for images. If /video is in the URL, that traffic is routed to another pool that's optimized for videos. This type of routing is known as application layer (OSI layer 7) load balancing.</p> <p></p> <p>Application Gateway includes the following features:</p> <ul> <li>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL/TLS) termination - Application gateway supports SSL/TLS termination at the gateway, after which traffic typically flows unencrypted to the backend servers. This feature allows web servers to be unburdened from costly encryption and decryption overhead.</li> <li>Autoscaling - Application Gateway Standard_v2 supports autoscaling and can scale up or down based on changing traffic load patterns. Autoscaling also removes the requirement to choose a deployment size or instance count during provisioning.</li> <li>Zone redundancy - A Standard_v2 Application Gateway can span multiple Availability Zones, offering better fault resiliency and removing the need to provision separate Application Gateways in each zone.</li> <li>Static VIP - The application gateway Standard_v2 SKU supports static VIP type exclusively. This ensures that the VIP associated with application gateway doesn't change even over the lifetime of the Application Gateway.</li> <li>Web Application Firewall - Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a service that provides centralized protection of your web applications from common exploits and vulnerabilities. WAF is based on rules from the OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) core rule sets 3.1 (WAF_v2 only), 3.0, and 2.2.9.</li> <li>Ingress Controller for AKS - Application Gateway Ingress Controller (AGIC) allows you to use Application Gateway as the ingress for an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.</li> <li>URL-based routing - URL Path Based Routing allows you to route traffic to back-end server pools based on URL Paths of the request. One of the scenarios is to route requests for different content types to different pool.</li> <li>Multiple-site hosting - Multiple-site hosting enables you to configure more than one web site on the same application gateway instance. This feature allows you to configure a more efficient topology for your deployments by adding up to 100 web sites to one Application Gateway (for optimal performance).</li> <li>Redirection - A common scenario for many web applications is to support automatic HTTP to HTTPS redirection to ensure all communication between an application and its users occurs over an encrypted path.</li> <li>Session affinity - The cookie-based session affinity feature is useful when you want to keep a user session on the same server.</li> <li>Websocket and HTTP/2 traffic - Application Gateway provides native support for the WebSocket and HTTP/2 protocols. There's no user-configurable setting to selectively enable or disable WebSocket support.</li> <li>Connection draining - Connection draining helps you achieve graceful removal of backend pool members during planned service updates.</li> <li>Custom error pages - Application Gateway allows you to create custom error pages instead of displaying default error pages. You can use your own branding and layout using a custom error page.</li> <li>Rewrite HTTP headers - HTTP headers allow the client and server to pass additional information with the request or the response.</li> <li>Sizing - Application Gateway Standard_v2 can be configured for autoscaling or fixed size deployments. This SKU doesn't offer different instance sizes.</li> </ul> <p>New Application Gateway v1 SKU deployments can take up to 20 minutes to provision. Changes to instance size or count aren't disruptive, and the gateway remains active during this time.</p> <p>Most deployments that use the v2 SKU take around 6 minutes to provision. However it can take longer depending on the type of deployment. For example, deployments across multiple Availability Zones with many instances can take more than 6 minutes.</p> <p>Deploy a web application firewall</p> <p>Web Application Firewall (WAF) provides centralized protection of your web applications from common exploits and vulnerabilities. Web applications are increasingly targeted by malicious attacks that exploit commonly known vulnerabilities. SQL injection and cross-site scripting are among the most common attacks.</p> <p></p> <p>Preventing such attacks in application code is challenging. It can require rigorous maintenance, patching, and monitoring at multiple layers of the application topology. A centralized web application firewall helps make security management much simpler. A WAF also gives application administrators better assurance of protection against threats and intrusions.</p> <p>A WAF solution can react to a security threat faster by centrally patching a known vulnerability, instead of securing each individual web application.</p> <p>Supported service</p> <p>WAF can be deployed with Azure Application Gateway, Azure Front Door, and Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) service from Microsoft. WAF on Azure CDN is currently under public preview. WAF has features that are customized for each specific service.</p> <p>Configure and manage Azure front door</p> <p>Azure Front Door enables you to define, manage, and monitor the global routing for your web traffic by optimizing for best performance and instant global failover for high availability. With Front Door, you can transform your global (multi-region) consumer and enterprise applications into robust, high-performance personalized modern applications, APIs, and content that reaches a global audience with Azure.</p> <p>Front Door works at Layer 7 or HTTP/HTTPS layer and uses split TCP-based anycast protocol. Front Door ensures that your end users promptly connect to the nearest Front Door POP (Point of Presence). So, per your routing method selection in the configuration, you can ensure that Front Door is routing your client requests to the fastest and most available application backend. An application backend is any Internet-facing service hosted inside or outside of Azure. Front Door provides a range of traffic-routing methods and backend health monitoring options to suit different application needs and automatic failover models. Like Traffic Manager, Front Door is resilient to failures, including the failure of an entire Azure region.</p> <p></p> <p>The following features are included with Front Door:</p> <ul> <li>Accelerate application performance - Using split TCP-based anycast protocol, Front Door ensures that your end users promptly connect to the nearest Front Door POP (Point of Presence).</li> <li>Increase application availability with smart health probes - Front Door delivers high availability for your critical applications using its smart health probes, monitoring your backends for both latency and availability and providing instant automatic failover when a backend goes down.</li> <li>URL-based routing - URL Path Based Routing allows you to route traffic to backend pools based on URL paths of the request. One of the scenarios is to route requests for different content types to different backend pools.</li> <li>Multiple-site hosting - Multiple-site hosting enables you to configure more than one web site on the same Front Door configuration.</li> <li>Session affinity - The cookie-based session affinity feature is useful when you want to keep a user session on the same application backend.</li> <li>TLS termination - Front Door supports TLS termination at the edge that is, individual users can set up a TLS connection with Front Door environments instead of establishing it over long haul connections with the application backend.</li> <li>Custom domains and certificate management - When you use Front Door to deliver content, a custom domain is necessary if you would like your own domain name to be visible in your Front Door URL.</li> <li>Application layer security - Azure Front Door allows you to author custom Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules for access control to protect your HTTP/HTTPS workload from exploitation based on client IP addresses, country code, and http parameters.</li> <li>URL redirection - With the strong industry push on supporting only secure communication, web applications are expected to automatically redirect any HTTP traffic to HTTPS.</li> <li>URL rewrite - Front Door supports URL rewrite by allowing you to configure an optional Custom Forwarding Path to use when constructing the request to forward to the backend.</li> <li>Protocol support - IPv6 and HTTP/2 traffic - Azure Front Door natively supports end-to-end IPv6 connectivity and HTTP/2 protocol.</li> </ul> <p>As mentioned above, routing to the Azure Front Door environments leverages Anycast for both DNS (Domain Name System) and HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) traffic, so user traffic will go to the closest environment in terms of network topology (fewest hops). This architecture typically offers better round-trip times for end users (maximizing the benefits of Split TCP). Front Door organizes its environments into primary and fallback \"rings\". The outer ring has environments that are closer to users, offering lower latencies. The inner ring has environments that can handle the failover for the outer ring environment in case an issue happens. The outer ring is the preferred target for all traffic, but the inner ring is necessary to handle traffic overflow from the outer ring. In terms of VIPs (Virtual Internet Protocol addresses), each frontend host, or domain served by Front Door is assigned a primary VIP, which is announced by environments in both the inner and outer ring, as well as a fallback VIP, which is only announced by environments in the inner ring.</p> <p>This overall strategy ensures that requests from your end users always reach the closest Front Door environment and that even if the preferred Front Door environment is unhealthy then traffic automatically moves to the next closest environment.</p> <p>Review ExpressRoute</p> <p>ExpressRoute is a direct, private connection from your WAN (not over the public Internet) to Microsoft Services, including Azure. Site-to-Site VPN traffic travels encrypted over the public Internet. Being able to configure Site-to-Site VPN and ExpressRoute connections for the same virtual network has several advantages.</p> <p>You can configure a Site-to-Site VPN as a secure failover path for ExpressRoute, or use Site-to-Site VPNs to connect to sites that are not part of your network, but that are connected through ExpressRoute. Notice that this configuration requires two virtual network gateways for the same virtual network, one using the gateway type 'Vpn', and the other using the gateway type 'ExpressRoute'.</p> <p></p> <p>ExpressRoute encryption</p> <p>IPsec over ExpressRoute for Virtual WAN</p> <p>Azure Virtual WAN uses an Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) Internet Key Exchange (IKE) VPN connection from your on-premises network to Azure over the private peering of an Azure ExpressRoute circuit. This technique can provide an encrypted transit between the on-premises networks and Azure virtual networks over ExpressRoute, without going over the public internet or using public IP addresses. The following diagram shows an example of VPN connectivity over ExpressRoute private peering.</p> <p></p> <p>The diagram shows a network within the on-premises network connected to the Azure hub VPN gateway over ExpressRoute private peering. The connectivity establishment is straightforward:</p> <ol> <li>Establish ExpressRoute connectivity with an ExpressRoute circuit and private peering.</li> <li>Establish the VPN connectivity.</li> </ol> <p>An important aspect of this configuration is routing between the on-premises networks and Azure over both the ExpressRoute and VPN paths.</p> <p>ExpressRoute supports a couple of encryption technologies to ensure confidentiality and integrity of the data traversing between your network and Microsoft's network.</p> <p>Point-to-point encryption by MACsec</p> <p>MACsec is an IEEE standard. It encrypts data at the Media Access control (MAC) level or Network Layer 2. You can use MACsec to encrypt the physical links between your network devices and Microsoft's network devices when you connect to Microsoft via ExpressRoute Direct. MACsec is disabled on ExpressRoute Direct ports by default. You bring your own MACsec key for encryption and store it in Azure Key Vault. You decide when to rotate the key.</p> <p>End-to-end encryption by IPsec and MACsec</p> <p>IPsec is an IETF standard. It encrypts data at the Internet Protocol (IP) level or Network Layer 3.

Zero Trust, means that you don't purchase from generic retailers but only supply hardware from an authorized OEM that support Autopilot.</p> <p>For this solution, root of trust will be deployed using Windows Autopilot technology with hardware that meets the modern technical requirements. To secure a workstation, Autopilot lets you leverage Microsoft OEM-optimized Windows 10 devices. These devices come in a known good state from the manufacturer. Instead of reimaging a potentially insecure device, Autopilot can transform a Windows 10 device into a \u201cbusiness-ready\u201d state. It applies settings and policies, installs apps, and even changes the edition of Windows 10.</p> <p></p> <p>Hardware root-of-trust To have a secured workstation you need to make sure the following security technologies are included on the device:</p> <ul> <li>Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0</li> <li>BitLocker Drive Encryption</li> <li>UEFI Secure Boot</li> <li>Drivers and Firmware Distributed through Windows Update</li> <li>Virtualization and HVCI Enabled</li> <li>Drivers and Apps HVCI-Ready</li> <li>Windows Hello</li> <li>DMA I/O Protection</li> <li>System Guard</li> <li>Modern Standby</li> </ul> <p>Levels of device security</p> Device Type Common usage scenario Permitted activities Security guidance Enterprise Device Home users, small business users, general purpose developers, and enterprise Run any application, browse any website Anti-malware and virus protection and policy based security posture for the enterprise.

PAW device <p>This chart shows the level of device security controls based on how the device will be used.</p> <p></p> <p>Device security controls</p> <p>A secure workstation requires it be part of an end-to-end approach including device security, account security, and security policies applied to the device at all times. Here are some common security measures you should consider implementing based on the users' needs. Using a device with security measures directly aligned to the security needs of it users is the more secure solution.</p> Security Control Enterprise Device Specialized Device Privileged Device Microsoft Endpoint Manager (MEM) managed Yes Yes Yes Deny BYOD Device enrollment No Yes Yes MEM security baseline applied Yes Yes Yes Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Yes Yes Yes Join personal device via Autopilot Yes Yes No URLs restricted to approved list Allow Most Allow Most Deny Default Removal of admin rights Yes Yes Application execution control (AppLocker) Audit -&gt; Enforced Yes Applications installed only by MEM Yes Yes <p>Deploy privileged access workstations Privileged Access Workstations (PAWs) provide a dedicated system for sensitive tasks that is protected from Internet attacks and threat vectors. Separating these sensitive tasks and accounts from the daily use workstations and devices provides very strong protection from phishing attacks, application and OS vulnerabilities, various impersonation attacks, and credential theft attacks such as keystroke logging, Pass-the-Hash, and Pass-The-Ticket.</p> <p>PAW workstations PAW is a hardened and locked down workstation designed to provide high security assurances for sensitive accounts and tasks. PAWs are recommended for administration of identity systems, cloud services, and private cloud fabric as well as sensitive business functions. In order to provide the greatest security, PAWs should always run the most up-to-date and secure operating system available: Microsoft strongly recommends Windows 10 Enterprise, which includes several additional security features not available in other editions (in particular, Credential Guard and Device Guard).</p> <p>The PAW security controls are focused on mitigating high impact and high probability risks of compromise. These include mitigating attacks on the environment and risks that can decrease the effectiveness of PAW controls over time:</p> <ul> <li>Internet attacks - Isolating the PAW from the open internet is a key element to ensuring the PAW is not compromised.</li> <li>Usability risk - If a PAW is too difficult to use for daily tasks, administrators will be motivated to create workarounds to make their jobs easier.</li> <li>Environment risks - Minimizing the use of management tools and accounts that have access to the PAWs to secure and monitor these specialized workstations.</li> <li>Supply chain tampering - Taking a few key actions can mitigate critical attack vectors that are readily available to attackers. This includes validating the integrity of all installation media (Clean Source Principle) and using a trusted and reputable supplier for hardware and software.</li> <li>Physical attacks - Because PAWs can be physically mobile and used outside of physically secure facilities, they must be protected against attacks that leverage unauthorized physical access to the computer.</li> </ul> <p>Architecture overview The diagram below depicts a separate \"channel\" for administration (a highly sensitive task) that is created by maintaining separate dedicated administrative accounts and workstations.</p> <p></p> <p>This architectural approach builds on the protections found in the Windows 10 Credential Guard and Device Guard features and goes beyond those protections for sensitive accounts and tasks.</p> <p>This methodology is appropriate for accounts with access to high value assets:</p> <ul> <li>Administrative Privileges - PAWs provide increased security for high impact IT administrative roles and tasks. This architecture can be applied to administration of many types of systems including Active Directory Domains and Forests, Microsoft Azure Active Directory tenants, Microsoft 365 tenants, Process Control Networks (PCN), Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, Automated Teller Machines (ATMs), and Point of Sale (PoS) devices.</li> <li>High Sensitivity Information workers - The approach used in a PAW can also provide protection for highly sensitive information worker tasks and personnel such as those involving pre-announcement Merger and Acquisition activity, pre-release financial reports, organizational social media presence, executive communications, unpatented trade secrets, sensitive research, or other proprietary or sensitive data. This guidance does not discuss the configuration of these information worker scenarios in depth or include this scenario in the technical instructions.</li> </ul> <p>Securing privileged access is a critical first step to establishing security assurances for business assets in a modern organization. The security of most or all business assets in an IT organization depends on the integrity of the privileged accounts used to administer, manage, and develop.</p> <p>Jump Box</p> <p>Administrative \"Jump Box\" architectures set up a small number administrative console servers and restrict personnel to using them for administrative tasks. This is typically based on remote desktop services, a 3rd-party presentation virtualization solution, or a Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) technology.</p> <p>This approach is frequently proposed to mitigate risk to administration and does provide some security assurances, but the jump box approach by itself is vulnerable to certain attacks because it violates the clean source principle. The clean source principle requires all security dependencies to be as trustworthy as the object being secured.</p> <p></p> <p>This figure depicts a simple control relationship. Any subject in control of an object is a security dependency of that object. If an adversary can control a security dependency of a target object (subject), they can control that object.</p> <p>The administrative session on the jump server relies on the integrity of the local computer accessing it. If this computer is a user workstation subject to phishing attacks and other internet-based attack vectors, then the administrative session is also subject to those risks.</p> <p>While some advanced security controls like multifactor authentication can increase the difficulty of an attacker taking over this administrative session from the user workstation, no security feature can fully protect against technical attacks when an attacker has administrative access of the source computer (e.g. injecting illicit commands into a legitimate session, hijacking legitimate processes, and so on.)</p> <p>The default configuration in this PAW guidance installs administrative tools on the PAW, but a jump server architecture can also be added if required.</p> <p></p> <p>This above figure shows how reversing the control relationship and accessing user apps from an admin workstation gives the attacker no path to the targeted object. The user jump box is still exposed to risk so appropriate protective controls, detective controls, and response processes should still be applied for that internet-facing computer.</p> <p>Create virtual machine templates</p> <p>Before diving into configuring VM policies and templates, you need to understand the features and functionality of Azure Resource Manager.</p> <p>Resource Manager is the deployment and management service for your Azure subscription. It provides a consistent management layer that allows you to create, update, and delete resources in your Azure subscription. You can use its access control, auditing, and tagging features to help secure and organize your resources after deployment.</p> <p>When you take actions through the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, the Azure CLI, REST APIs, or client SDKs, the Resource Manager API handles your request. Because the same API handles all requests, you get consistent results and capabilities in all the different tools.</p> <p>Here are some additional terms to know when using Resource Manager:</p> <ul> <li>Resource provider. A service that supplies Azure resources. For example, a common resource provider is Microsoft.Compute, which supplies the VM resource. Microsoft.Storage is another common resource provider.</li> <li>Resource Manager template. A JSON file that defines one or more resources to deploy to a resource group or subscription. You can use the template to consistently and repeatedly deploy the resources.</li> <li>Declarative syntax. Syntax that lets you state, \"Here\u2019s what I intend to create\" without having to write the sequence of programming commands to create it. The Resource Manager template is an example of declarative syntax. In the file, you define the properties for the infrastructure to deploy to Azure.</li> </ul> <p>You can use the Resource Manager template to define your VMs. After they are defined you can easily deploy and redeploy them. We recommend periodically redeploying your VMs to force the deployment of a freshly updated and security-enhanced VM OS.</p> <p>Template design How you define templates and resource groups is entirely up to you and how you want to manage your solution. For example, you can deploy your three tier application through a single template to a single resource group.</p> <p></p> <p>But, you don't have to define your entire infrastructure in a single template. Often, it makes sense to divide your deployment requirements into a set of targeted, purpose-specific templates. You can easily reuse these templates for different solutions. To deploy a particular solution, you create a master template that links all the required templates. If you envision your tiers having separate lifecycles, you can deploy your three tiers to separate resource groups. Notice the resources can still be linked to resources in other resource groups.</p> <p></p> <pre><code>Important\n\nWhen you deploy a template, Resource Manager converts the template into REST API operations.\n</code></pre> <p>Enable and secure remote access management</p> <p>This topic explains how to connect to and sign into the virtual machines (VMs) you created on Azure. Once you've successfully connected, you can work with the VM as if you were locally logged on to its host server.</p> <p>Connect to a Windows VM</p> <p>The most common way to connect to a Windows based VM running in Azure is by using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Most versions of Windows natively contain support for the remote desktop protocol (RDP). If you are connecting to a Windows VM from a Mac, you will need to install an RDP client for Mac.</p> <p>If you are using PowerShell and have the Azure PowerShell module installed you may also connect using the Get-AzRemoteDesktopFile cmdlet.</p> <p>Connect to a Linux-based VM</p> <p>To connect the Linux-based VM, you need a secure shell protocol (SSH) client. The most used free tool is PuTTY SSH terminal. The following shows the PuTTY configuration dialog.</p> <p></p> <p>Azure Bastion The Azure Bastion service is a fully platform-managed PaaS service that you provision inside your virtual network. It provides secure and seamless RDP/SSH connectivity to your virtual machines directly in the Azure portal over TLS. When you connect using Azure Bastion, your virtual machines do not need a public IP address.</p> <p>Bastion provides secure RDP and SSH connectivity to all the VMs in the virtual network in which it is provisioned. Using Azure Bastion protects your virtual machines from exposing RDP/SSH ports to the outside world, while still providing secure access using RDP/SSH. With Azure Bastion, you connect to the virtual machine directly from the Azure portal.</p> <p>Architecture Azure Bastion is deployed to a virtual network and supports virtual network peering. Specifically, Azure Bastion manages RDP/SSH connectivity to VMs created in the local or peered virtual networks.</p> <p>RDP and SSH are some of the fundamental means through which you can connect to your workloads running in Azure. Exposing RDP/SSH ports over the Internet isn't desired and is seen as a significant threat surface. This is often due to protocol vulnerabilities. To contain this threat surface, you can deploy bastion hosts (also known as jump-servers) at the public side of your perimeter network. Bastion host servers are designed and configured to withstand attacks. Bastion servers also provide RDP and SSH connectivity to the workloads sitting behind the bastion, as well as further inside the network.</p> <p></p> <p>This figure shows the architecture of an Azure Bastion deployment. In this diagram:</p> <ul> <li>The Bastion host is deployed in the virtual network.</li> <li>The user connects to the Azure portal using any HTML5 browser.</li> <li>The user selects the virtual machine to connect to.</li> <li>With a single click, the RDP/SSH session opens in the browser.</li> <li>No public IP is required on the Azure VM.</li> </ul> <p>Key features</p> <p>The following features are available:</p> <ul> <li>RDP and SSH directly in Azure portal: You can directly get to the RDP and SSH session directly in the Azure portal using a single click seamless experience.</li> <li>Remote Session over TLS and firewall traversal for RDP/SSH: Azure Bastion uses an HTML5 based web client that is automatically streamed to your local device, so that you get your RDP/SSH session over TLS on port 443 enabling you to traverse corporate firewalls securely.</li> <li>No Public IP required on the Azure VM: Azure Bastion opens the RDP/SSH connection to your Azure virtual machine using private IP on your VM. You don't need a public IP on your virtual machine.</li> <li>No hassle of managing NSGs: Azure Bastion is a fully managed platform PaaS service from Azure that is hardened internally to provide you secure RDP/SSH connectivity. You don't need to apply any NSGs on Azure Bastion subnet. Because Azure Bastion connects to your virtual machines over private IP, you can configure your NSGs to allow RDP/SSH from Azure Bastion only.</li> <li>Protection against port scanning: Because you do not need to expose your virtual machines to public Internet, your VMs are protected against port scanning by rogue and malicious users located outside your virtual network.</li> <li>Protect against zero-day exploits. Hardening in one place only: Azure Bastion is a fully platform-managed PaaS service. Because it sits at the perimeter of your virtual network, you don\u2019t need to worry about hardening each of the virtual machines in your virtual network.</li> </ul> <p>Configure update management</p> <p>Azure Update Management is a service included as part of your Azure subscription. With Update Management, you can assess your update status across your environment and manage your Windows Server and Linux server updates from a single location\u2014for both your on-premises and Azure environments.</p> <p>Update Management is available at no additional cost (you pay only for the log data that Azure Log Analytics stores), and you can easily enable it for Azure and on-premises VMs. To try it, navigate to your VM tab in Azure, and then enable Update Management for one or more of your VMs. You can also enable Update Management for VMs directly from your Azure Automation account. Making updates easy, is one of the key factors in maintaining good security hygiene.</p> <p>Azure Update Management overview</p> <p>Computers that Update Management manages use the following configurations to perform assessment and update deployments:</p> <ul> <li>Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) for Windows or Linux</li> <li>Desired State Configuration (DSC) in Windows PowerShell for Linux</li> <li>Hybrid Runbook Worker in Azure Automation</li> <li>Microsoft Update or Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) for Windows computers</li> </ul> <p>Azure Automation uses runbooks to install updates. You can't view these runbooks, and they don\u2019t require any configuration. When an update deployment is created, it creates a schedule that starts a master update runbook at the specified time for the included computers. The master runbook starts a child runbook on each agent to install the required updates.</p> <p>The following diagram is a conceptual depiction of the behavior and data flow together with how the solution assesses and applies security updates to all connected Windows Server and Linux computers in a workspace.</p> <p></p> <p>Manage updates for multiple machines</p> <p>You can use the Update Management solution to manage updates and patches for your Windows and Linux virtual machines. From your Azure Automation account, you can:</p> <ul> <li>Onboard virtual machines</li> <li>Assess the status of available updates</li> <li>Schedule installation of required updates</li> <li>Review deployment results to verify that updates were applied successfully to all virtual machines for which Update Management is enabled</li> </ul> <p>The Log Analytics agent for Windows and Linux needs to be installed on the VMs that are running on your corporate network or other cloud environment in order to enable them with Update Management.</p> <p>After you enable Update Management for your machines, you can view machine information by selecting Computers. You can view information about machine name, compliance status, environment, OS type, critical and security updates installed, other updates installed, and update agent readiness for your computers.</p> <p></p> <p>Computers that have recently been enabled for Update Management might not have been assessed yet.

The alerts show as High Severity and the recommendation is to encrypt these VMs.</p> <p>Azure Disk Encryption is zone resilient, the same way as Virtual Machines.</p> <p>Supported VMs and operating systems</p> <p>Supported VMs Windows VMs are available in a range of sizes. Azure Disk Encryption is supported on Generation 1 and Generation 2 VMs. Azure Disk Encryption is also available for VMs with premium storage.</p> <p>Azure Disk Encryption is not available on Basic, A-series VMs, or on virtual machines with less than 2 GB of memory.</p> <p>Supported operating systems    - Windows client: Windows 8 and later.    - Windows Server: Windows Server 2008 R2 and later.    - Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session.</p> <p>Networking requirements To enable Azure Disk Encryption, the VMs must meet the following network endpoint configuration requirements:</p> <ul> <li>To get a token to connect to your key vault, the Windows VM must be able to connect to an Azure Active Directory endpoint, [login.microsoftonline.com].</li> <li>To write the encryption keys to your key vault, the Windows VM must be able to connect to the key vault endpoint.</li> <li>The Windows VM must be able to connect to an Azure storage endpoint that hosts the Azure extension repository and an Azure storage account that hosts the VHD files.</li> <li>If your security policy limits access from Azure VMs to the Internet, you can resolve the preceding URI and configure a specific rule to allow outbound connectivity to the IPs.</li> </ul> <p>Group Policy requirements</p> <p>Azure Disk Encryption uses the BitLocker external key protector for Windows VMs. For domain joined VMs, don't push any group policies that enforce TPM protectors.</p> <p>BitLocker policy on domain joined virtual machines with custom group policy must include the following setting: Configure user storage of BitLocker recovery information -&gt; Allow 256-bit recovery key. Azure Disk Encryption will fail when custom group policy settings for BitLocker are incompatible. On machines that didn't have the correct policy setting, apply the new policy, force the new policy to update (gpupdate.exe /force), and then restarting may be required.</p> <p>Azure Disk Encryption will fail if domain level group policy blocks the AES-CBC algorithm, which is used by BitLocker.</p> <p>Encryption key storage requirements</p> <p>Azure Disk Encryption requires an Azure Key Vault to control and manage disk encryption keys and secrets. Your key vault and VMs must reside in the same Azure region and subscription.</p> <p>Azure Disk Encryption for Linux VMs</p> <p>Azure Disk Encryption helps protect and safeguard your data to meet your organizational security and compliance commitments. It uses the DM-Crypt feature of Linux to provide volume encryption for the OS and data disks of Azure virtual machines (VMs) and is integrated with Azure Key Vault to help you control and manage the disk encryption keys and secrets.</p> <p>As for Windows VMs, if you use Microsoft Defender for Cloud, you're alerted if you have VMs that aren't encrypted. The alerts show as High Severity and the recommendation is to encrypt these VMs.</p> <p>Supported VMs and operating systems</p> <p>Supported VMs Linux VMs are available in a range of sizes. Azure Disk Encryption is supported on Generation 1 and Generation 2 VMs. Azure Disk Encryption is also available for VMs with premium storage.</p> <p>Note: Azure Disk Encryption is not available on Basic, A-series VMs, or on virtual machines that do not meet these minimum memory requirements:</p> Virtual machine Minimum memory requirement Linux VMs when only encrypting data volumes 2 GB Linux VMs when encrypting both data and OS volumes, and where the root (/) file system usage is 4GB or less 8 GB Linux VMs when encrypting both data and OS volumes, and where the root (/) file system usage is greater than 4GB The root file system usage * 2. For instance, a 16 GB of root file system usage requires at least 32GB of RAM <p>Once the OS disk encryption process is complete on Linux virtual machines, the VM can be configured to run with less memory.</p> <p>Azure Disk Encryption requires the dm-crypt and vfat modules to be present on the system. Removing or disabling vfat from the default image will prevent the system from reading the key volume and obtaining the key needed to unlock the disks on subsequent reboots. System hardening steps that remove the vfat module from the system are not compatible with Azure Disk Encryption</p> <p>Managed disk encryption options</p> <p>Managed disk Encryption Options</p> <p>There are several types of encryption available for your managed disks, including Azure Disk Encryption (ADE), Server-Side Encryption (SSE), and encryption at the host.</p> <ul> <li>Azure Disk Encryption helps protect and safeguard your data to meet organizational security and compliance commitments. ADE encrypts the OS and data disks of Azure virtual machines (VMs) inside your VMs by using the device mapper DM-Crypt feature of Linux or the BitLocker feature of Windows. Azure Disk Encryption (ADE) is integrated with Azure Key Vault to help you control and manage the disk encryption keys and secrets.</li> <li>Azure Disk Storage Server-Side Encryption (also referred to as encryption-at-rest or Azure Storage encryption) automatically encrypts data stored on Azure-managed disks (OS and data disks) when persisting on the Storage Clusters. When configured with a Disk Encryption Set (DES), it supports customer-managed keys as well.</li> <li>Encryption at the host ensures that data stored on the VM host hosting your VM is encrypted at rest and flows encrypted to the Storage clusters.</li> <li>Confidential disk encryption binds disk encryption keys to the virtual machine's TPM (Trusted Platform Module) and makes the protected disk content accessible only to the VM. The TPM and VM guest state is always encrypted in attested code using keys released by a secure protocol that bypasses the hypervisor and host operating system. Currently only available for the OS disk. Encryption at the host may be used for other disks on a Confidential VM in addition to Confidential Disk Encryption.</li> </ul> <p>Encryption is part of a layered approach to security and should be used with other recommendations to secure Virtual Machines and their disks.</p> <p>Comparison</p> <p>The following is a comparison of Storage Server-Side Encryption (SSE), Azure Disk Encryption (ADE), encryption at the host, and Confidential disk encryption.</p> <p></p> <pre><code>Important\n\nFor Encryption at the host and Confidential disk encryption, Microsoft Defender for Cloud does not detect the encryption state. We are in the process of updating Microsoft Defender.\n</code></pre> <p>Deploy and configure Windows Defender Windows 10, Windows Server 2019, and Windows Server 2016 include key security features. They are Windows Defender Credential Guard, Windows Defender Device Guard, and Windows Defender Application Control.</p> <p>Windows Defender Credential Guard Introduced in Windows 10 Enterprise and Windows Server 2016, Windows Defender Credential Guard uses virtualization-based security enhancement to isolate secrets so that only privileged system software can access them. Unauthorized access to these secrets might lead to credential theft attacks, such as Pass-the-Hash or pass-the-ticket attacks. Windows Defender Credential Guard helps prevent these attacks by helping protect Integrated Windows Authentication (NTLM) password hashes, Kerberos authentication ticket-granting tickets, and credentials that applications store as domain credentials.</p> <p>By enabling Windows Defender Credential Guard, you get the following features and solutions:</p> <ul> <li>Hardware security enhancement. NTLM, Kerberos, and Credential Manager take advantage of platform security features, including Secure Boot and virtualization, to help protect credentials.</li> <li>Virtualization-based security enhancement. NTLM-derived credentials, Kerberos-derived credentials, and other secrets run in a protected environment that is isolated from the running operating system.</li> <li>Better protection against advanced persistent threats. When virtualization-based security enhancement helps protect Credential Manager domain credentials, NTLM-derived credentials, and Kerberos-derived credentials, the credential theft attack techniques and tools that many targeted attacks use are blocked. Malware running in the OS with administrative privileges can\u2019t extract secrets that virtualization-based security helps protect. Although Windows Defender Credential Guard provides powerful mitigation, persistent threat attacks will likely shift to new attack techniques, so you should also incorporate Windows Defender Device Guard and other security strategies and architectures.</li> </ul> <p>Windows Defender Device Guard and Windows Defender Application Control</p> <p>The configuration state of Windows Defender Device Guard was originally designed with a specific security idea in mind. Although no direct dependencies existed between the two main OS features of the Windows Defender Device Guard configuration\u2014that is, between configurable code integrity and Hypervisor-protected code integrity (HVCI)\u2014the discussion intentionally focused on the Windows Defender Device Guard lockdown state that can be achieved when they\u2019re deployed together.</p> <p>However, the use of the term device guard to describe this configuration state has unintentionally left many IT pros with the impression that the two features are inexorably linked and can\u2019t be separately deployed. Additionally, because HVCI relies on security based on Windows virtualization, it comes with additional hardware, firmware, and kernel driver compatibility requirements that some older systems can\u2019t meet.</p> <p>As a result, many IT pros assumed that because some systems couldn't use HVCI, they couldn\u2019t use configurable code integrity, either. But configurable code integrity has no specific hardware or software requirements other than running Windows 10, which means that many IT pros were wrongly denied the benefits of this powerful application control capability.</p> <p>Since the initial release of Windows 10, the world has witnessed numerous hacking and malware attacks where application control alone might have prevented the attack altogether. Configurable code integrity is now documented as an independent technology within the Microsoft security stack and given a name of its own: Windows Defender Application Control.</p> <p>Application control is a crucial line of defense for helping protect enterprises given today\u2019s threat landscape, and it has an inherent advantage over traditional antivirus solutions. Specifically, application control moves away from the traditional application trust model, in which all applications are assumed trustworthy by default, to one where applications must earn trust to run. Many organizations understand this and frequently cite application control as one of the most effective means for addressing the threat of malware based on executable files (such as .exe and .dll files).</p> <p>Windows Defender Application Control helps mitigate these types of threats by restricting the applications that users can run and the code that runs in the system core, or kernel. Policies in Windows Defender Application Control also block unsigned scripts and MSIs, and Windows PowerShell runs in Constrained language mode.</p> <p>Does this mean the Windows Defender Device Guard configuration state is going away? Not at all. The term device guard will continue to describe the fully locked down state achieved using Windows Defender Application Control, HVCI, and hardware and firmware security features. It will also allow Microsoft to work with its original equipment manufacturer (OEM) partners to identify specifications for devices that are device guard capable\u2014so that joint customers can easily purchase devices that meet all the hardware and firmware requirements of the original locked down scenario of Windows Defender Device Guard for Windows 10 devices.</p> <p>Microsoft Defender for Endpoint - Supported Operating Systems</p> <p></p> <p>Microsoft cloud security benchmark in Defender for Cloud</p> <p>The Microsoft cloud security benchmark (MCSB) provides prescriptive best practices and recommendations to help improve the security of workloads, data, and services on Azure and your multicloud environment. This benchmark focuses on cloud-centric control areas with input from a set of holistic Microsoft and industry security guidance that includes:</p> <ul> <li>Cloud Adoption Framework: Guidance on security, including strategy, roles and responsibilities, Azure Top 10 Security Best Practices, and reference implementation.</li> <li>Azure Well-Architected Framework: Guidance on securing your workloads on Azure.</li> <li>The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) Workshop: Program guidance and reference strategies to accelerate security modernization using Zero Trust principles.</li> <li>Other industry and cloud service provider's security best practice standards and framework: Examples include the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Well-Architected Framework, Center for Internet Security (CIS) Controls, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS).</li> </ul> <p>Microsoft cloud security benchmark features</p> <p>Comprehensive multicloud security framework: Organizations often have to build an internal security standard to reconcile security controls across multiple cloud platforms to meet security and compliance requirements on each of them. This often requires security teams to repeat the same implementation, monitoring, and assessment across the different cloud environments (often for different compliance standards). This creates unnecessary overhead, cost, and effort. To address this concern, we enhanced the Azure Security Benchmark (ASB) to the Microsoft cloud security benchmark (MCSB) to help you quickly work with different clouds by:</p> <ul> <li>Providing a single control framework to easily meet the security controls across clouds</li> <li>Providing consistent user experience for monitoring and enforcing the multicloud security benchmark in Defender for Cloud</li> <li>Staying aligned with Industry Standards (e.g., Center for Internet Security, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Payment Card Industry)</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Automated control monitoring for AWS in Microsoft Defender for Cloud: You can use Microsoft Defender for Cloud Regulatory Compliance Dashboard to monitor your AWS environment against Microsoft cloud security benchmark (MCSB), just like how you monitor your Azure environment. We developed approximately 180 AWS checks for the new AWS security guidance in MCSB, allowing you to monitor your AWS environment and resources in Microsoft Defender for Cloud.</p> <p>Example: Microsoft Defender for Cloud - Regulatory compliance dashboard</p> <p></p> <p>Azure guidance and security principles: Azure security guidance, security principles, features, and capabilities.</p> <p>Controls</p> Control Domains Description Network security (NS) Network Security covers controls to secure and protect networks, including securing virtual networks, establishing private connections, preventing and mitigating external attacks, and securing Domain Name System (DNS).

It then provides you with recommendations on how to remediate those issues. Recommendations result from assessing your resources against the relevant policies and identifying resources that aren't meeting your defined requirements.</p> <p>Defender for Cloud makes its security recommendations based on your chosen initiatives. When a policy from your initiative is compared against your resources and finds one or more that aren't compliant, it is presented as a recommendation in Defender for Cloud.</p> <p>Example: Microsoft Defender for Cloud - All recommendations</p> <p></p> <p>Recommendations are actions for you to take to secure and harden your resources. Each recommendation provides you with the following information:</p> <ul> <li>A short description of the issue</li> <li>The remediation steps to carry out in order to implement the recommendation</li> <li>The affected resources</li> </ul> <p>In practice, it works like this:</p> <ol> <li>Azure Security Benchmark is an initiative that contains requirements.       For example, Azure Storage accounts must restrict network access to reduce their attack surface.</li> <li>The initiative includes multiple policies, each requiring a specific resource type. These policies enforce the requirements in the initiative.    To continue the example, the storage requirement is enforced with the policy \"Storage accounts should restrict network access using virtual network rules.\"</li> <li>Microsoft Defender for Cloud continually assesses your connected subscriptions. If it finds a resource that doesn't satisfy a policy, it displays a recommendation to fix that situation and harden the security of resources that aren't meeting your security requirements.</li> </ol> <p>For example, if an Azure Storage account on your protected subscriptions isn't protected with virtual network rules, you'll see the recommendation to harden those resources.</p> <p>So, (1) an initiative includes (2) policies that generate (3) environment-specific recommendations.</p> <p>Perform Try-This exercises</p> <p>Use this Try-This exercises to get some hands-on experience with Azure.</p> <p>In this demonstration, we'll configure the Bastion service, virtual machine updates, virtual machine extensions, and disk encryption.

Containers build on top of the host operating system's kernel (which can be thought of as the buried plumbing of the operating system), and contain only apps and some lightweight operating system APIs and services that run in user mode. While a container shares the host operating system's kernel, the container doesn't get unfettered access to it. Instead, the container gets an isolated\u2013and in some cases virtualized\u2013view of the system. For example, a container can access a virtualized version of the file system and registry, but any changes affect only the container and are discarded when it stops. To save data, the container can mount persistent storage such as an Azure Disk or a file share (including Azure Files).</p> <p>You need Docker in order to work with Windows Containers. Docker consists of the Docker Engine (dockerd.exe), and the Docker client (docker.exe).</p> <p>How it works A container builds on top of the kernel, but the kernel doesn't provide all of the APIs and services an app needs to run\u2013most of these are provided by system files (libraries) that run above the kernel in user mode. Because a container is isolated from the host's user mode environment, the container needs its own copy of these user mode system files, which are packaged into something known as a base image. The base image serves as the foundational layer upon which your container is built, providing it with operating system services not provided by the kernel.</p> <p></p> <p>Because containers require far fewer resources (for example, they don't need a full OS), they're easy to deploy and they start fast. This allows you to have higher density, meaning that it allows you to run more services on the same hardware unit, thereby reducing costs.</p> <p>As a side effect of running on the same kernel, you get less isolation than VMs.</p> <p>Features of Containers</p> Features Description Isolation Typically provides lightweight isolation from the host and   other containers, but doesn't provide as strong a security boundary as a VM.   (You can increase the security by using Hyper-V isolation mode to isolate   each container in a lightweight VM). Operating System Runs the user mode portion of an operating system, and can be   tailored to contain just the needed services for your app, using fewer system   resources. Deployment Deploy individual containers by using Docker via command line;   deploy multiple containers by using an orchestrator such as Azure Kubernetes   Service. Persistent storage Use Azure Disks for local storage for a single node, or Azure   Files (SMB shares) for storage shared by multiple nodes or servers. Fault tolerance If a cluster node fails, any containers running on it are   rapidly recreated by the orchestrator on another cluster node. Networking Uses an isolated view of a virtual network adapter, providing   a little less virtualization\u2013the host's firewall is shared with   containers\u2013while using less resources. <p>In Docker, each layer is the resulting set of changes that happen to the filesystem after executing a command, such as, installing a program. So, when you view the filesystem after the layer has been copied, you can view all the files, including the layer when the program was installed. You can think of an image as an auxiliary read-only hard disk ready to be installed in a \"computer\" where the operating system is already installed. Similarly, you can think of a container as the \"computer\" with the image hard disk installed. The container, just like a computer, can be powered on or off.</p> <p>Configure Azure Container Instances security</p> <p>Use a private registry</p> <p>Containers are built from images that are stored in one or more repositories. These repositories can belong to a public registry, like Docker Hub, or to a private registry. An example of a private registry is the Docker Trusted Registry, which can be installed on-premises or in a virtual private cloud. You can also use cloud-based private container registry services, including Azure Container Registry.</p> <p>A publicly available container image does not guarantee security. Container images consist of multiple software layers, and each software layer might have vulnerabilities. To help reduce the threat of attacks, you should store and retrieve images from a private registry, such as Azure Container Registry or Docker Trusted Registry. In addition to providing a managed private registry, Azure Container Registry supports service principal-based authentication through Azure Active Directory for basic authentication flows. This authentication includes role-based access for read-only (pull), write (push), and other permissions.</p> <p>Monitor and scan container images continuously</p> <p>Take advantage of solutions to scan container images in a private registry and identify potential vulnerabilities. It\u2019s important to understand the depth of threat detection that the different solutions provide.</p> <p>For example, Azure Container Registry optionally integrates with Microsoft Defender for Cloud to automatically scan all Linux images pushed to a registry. Microsoft Defender for Cloud integrated Qualys scanner detects image vulnerabilities, classifies them, and provides remediation guidance.</p> <p>Protect credentials Containers can spread across several clusters and Azure regions. So, you must secure credentials required for logins or API access, such as passwords or tokens. Ensure that only privileged users can access those containers in transit and at rest. Inventory all credential secrets, and then require developers to use emerging secrets-management tools that are designed for container platforms. Make sure that your solution includes encrypted databases, TLS encryption for secrets data in transit, and least-privilege role-based access control. Azure Key Vault is a cloud service that safeguards encryption keys and secrets (such as certificates, connection strings, and passwords) for containerized applications. Because this data is sensitive and business critical, secure access to your key vaults so that only authorized applications and users can access them.</p> <p>Use vulnerability management as part of your container development lifecycle</p> <p>By using effective vulnerability management throughout the container development lifecycle, you improve the odds that you identify and resolve security concerns before they become a more serious problem.</p> <p>Scan for vulnerabilities</p> <p>New vulnerabilities are discovered all the time, so scanning for and identifying vulnerabilities is a continuous process. Incorporate vulnerability scanning throughout the container lifecycle:</p> <ul> <li>As a final check in your development pipeline, you should perform a vulnerability scan on containers before pushing the images to a public or private registry.</li> <li>Continue to scan container images in the registry both to identify any flaws that were somehow missed during development and to address any newly discovered vulnerabilities that might exist in the code used in the container images.</li> </ul> <p>Ensure that only approved images are used in your environment</p> <p>There\u2019s enough change and volatility in a container ecosystem without allowing unknown containers as well. Allow only approved container images. Have tools and processes in place to monitor for and prevent the use of unapproved container images.</p> <p>An effective way of reducing the attack surface and preventing developers from making critical security mistakes is to control the flow of container images into your development environment. For example, you might sanction a single Linux distribution as a base image, preferably one that is lean (Alpine or CoreOS rather than Ubuntu), to minimize the surface for potential attacks.</p> <p>Image signing or fingerprinting can provide a chain of custody that enables you to verify the integrity of the containers. For example, Azure Container Registry supports Docker's content trust model, which allows image publishers to sign images that are pushed to a registry, and image consumers to pull only signed images.</p> <p>Enforce least privileges in runtime</p> <p>The concept of least privileges is a basic security best practice that also applies to containers. When a vulnerability is exploited, it generally gives the attacker access and privileges equal to those of the compromised application or process. Ensuring that containers operate with the lowest privileges and access required to get the job done reduces your exposure to risk.</p> <p>Reduce the container attack surface by removing unneeded privileges</p> <p>You can also minimize the potential attack surface by removing any unused or unnecessary processes or privileges from the container runtime. Privileged containers run as root. If a malicious user or workload escapes in a privileged container, the container will then run as root on that system.</p> <p>Log all container administrative user access for auditing</p> <p>Maintain an accurate audit trail of administrative access to your container ecosystem, including your Kubernetes cluster, container registry, and container images. These logs might be necessary for auditing purposes and will be useful as forensic evidence after any security incident. Azure solutions include:</p> <ul> <li>Integration of Azure Kubernetes Service with Microsoft Defender for Cloud to monitor the security configuration of the cluster environment and generate security recommendations</li> <li>Azure Container Monitoring solution</li> <li>Resource logs for Azure Container Instances and Azure Container Registry</li> </ul> <p>Manage security for Azure Container Instances (ACI)</p> <p>Azure Container Instances (ACI), is a PaaS service for scenario that can operate in isolated containers, including simple applications, task automation, and build jobs. For scenarios where you need full container orchestration, including service discovery across multiple containers, automatic scaling, and coordinated application upgrades, we recommend Azure Kubernetes Service (which will be covered later on in this lesson).</p> <p>Features of ACI</p> <p>Fast startup times Containers offer significant startup benefits over virtual machines (VMs). Azure Container Instances can start containers in Azure in seconds, without the need to provision and manage VMs.</p> <p>Container access</p> <ul> <li>Azure Container Instances enables exposing your container groups directly to the internet with an IP address and a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). When you create a container instance, you can specify a custom DNS name label so your application is reachable at customlabel.azureregion.azurecontainer.io.</li> <li>Azure Container Instances also supports executing a command in a running container by providing an interactive shell to help with application development and troubleshooting. Access takes places over HTTPS, using TLS to secure client connections.</li> </ul> <p>Container deployment</p> <p>Deploy containers from DockerHub or Azure Container Registry.</p> <p>Hypervisor-level security Historically, containers have offered application dependency isolation and resource governance but have not been considered sufficiently hardened for hostile multi-tenant usage. Azure Container Instances guarantees your application is as isolated in a container as it would be in a VM.</p> <p>Custom sizes Containers are typically optimized to run just a single application, but the exact needs of those applications can differ greatly. Azure Container Instances provides optimum utilization by allowing exact specifications of CPU cores and memory. You pay based on what you need and get billed by the second, so you can fine-tune your spending based on actual need.</p> <p>For compute-intensive jobs such as machine learning, Azure Container Instances can schedule Linux containers to use NVIDIA Tesla GPU resources.</p> <p>Persistent storage To retrieve and persist state with Azure Container Instances, we offer direct mounting of Azure Files shares backed by Azure Storage.</p> <p>Flexible billing</p> <p>Supports per-GB, per-CPU, and per-second billing.</p> <p>Linux and Windows containers Azure Container Instances can schedule both Windows and Linux containers with the same API. Simply specify the OS type when you create your container groups.</p> <p>Some features are currently restricted to Linux containers:</p> <ul> <li>Multiple containers per container group</li> <li>Volume mounting (Azure Files, emptyDir, GitRepo, secret)</li> <li>Resource usage metrics with Azure Monitor</li> <li>Virtual network deployment</li> <li>GPU resources (preview)</li> </ul> <p>For Windows container deployments, use images based on common Windows base images.</p> <p>Co-scheduled groups Azure Container Instances supports scheduling of multi-container groups that share a host machine, local network, storage, and lifecycle. This enables you to combine your main application container with other supporting role containers, such as logging sidecars.</p> <p>Virtual network deployment Currently available for production workloads in a subset of Azure regions, this feature of Azure Container Instances enables deployment of container instances into an Azure virtual network. By deploying container instances into a subnet within your virtual network, they can communicate securely with other resources in the virtual network, including those that are on premises (through VPN gateway or ExpressRoute).</p> <p>Explore the Azure Container Registry (ACR)</p> <p>A container registry is a service that stores and distributes container images. Docker Hub is a public container registry that supports the open source community and serves as a general catalog of images. Azure Container Registry provides users with direct control of their images, with integrated authentication, geo-replication supporting global distribution and reliability for network-close deployments, virtual network and firewall configuration, tag locking, and many other enhanced features.</p> <p>In addition to Docker container images, Azure Container Registry supports related content artifacts including Open Container Initiative (OCI) image formats.</p> <p></p> <p>Security and access</p> <p>You log in to a registry using the Azure CLI or the standard docker login command. Azure Container Registry transfers container images over HTTPS, and supports TLS to secure client connections. Azure Container Registry requires all secure connections from servers and applications to use TLS 1.2. Enable TLS 1.2 by using any recent docker client (version 18.03.0 or later). You control access to a container registry using an Azure identity, an Azure Active Directory-backed service principal, or a provided admin account. Use role-based access control (RBAC) to assign users or systems fine-grained permissions to a registry.</p> <p>Security features of the Premium SKU include content trust for image tag signing, and firewalls and virtual networks to restrict access to the registry. Microsoft Defender for Cloud optionally integrates with Azure Container Registry to scan images whenever an image is pushed to a registry.</p> <p>Repository</p> <p>Container registries manage repositories, collections of container images or other artifacts with the same name, but different tags. For example, the following three images are in the \"acr-helloworld\" repository:</p> <ul> <li>acr-helloworld:latest</li> <li>acr-helloworld:v1</li> <li>acr-helloworld:v2</li> </ul> <p>Image</p> <p>A container image or other artifact within a registry is associated with one or more tags, has one or more layers, and is identified by a manifest. Understanding how these components relate to each other can help you manage your registry effectively.</p> <p>Monitor container activity and user access</p> <p>As with any IT environment, you should consistently monitor activity and user access to your container ecosystem to quickly identify any suspicious or malicious activity. The container monitoring solution in Log Analytics can help you view and manage your Docker and Windows container hosts in a single location.</p> <p>By using Log Analytics, you can:</p> <ul> <li>View detailed audit information that shows commands used with containers.</li> <li>Troubleshoot containers by viewing and searching centralized logs without having to remotely view Docker or Windows hosts.</li> <li>Find containers that may be noisy and consuming excess resources on a host.</li> <li>View centralized CPU, memory, storage, and network usage and performance information for containers.</li> </ul> <p>On computers running Windows, you can centralize and compare logs from Windows Server, Hyper-V, and Docker containers. The solution supports container orchestrators such as Docker Swarm, DC/OS, Kubernetes, Service Fabric, and Red Hat OpenShift.</p> <p>Container technology is causing a structural change in the cloud-computing world. Containers make it possible to run multiple instances of an application on a single instance of an operating system, thereby using resources more efficiently. Containers give organizations consistency and flexibility. They enable continuous deployment because the application can be developed on a desktop, tested in a virtual machine, and then deployed for production in the cloud. Containers provide agility, streamlined operations, scalability, and reduced costs due to resource optimization.</p> <p>Enable Azure Container Registry authentication</p> <p>There are several ways to authenticate with an Azure container registry, each of which is applicable to one or more registry usage scenarios.</p> <p>Recommended ways include authenticating to a registry directly via individual login, or your applications and container orchestrators can perform unattended, or \"headless,\" authentication by using an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) service principal.</p> <p>Authentication options</p> <p>The following table lists available authentication methods and recommended scenarios.</p> Identity Usage scenario Details Azure AD identities including   user and service principals Unattended push from DevOps, unattended pull to Azure or   external services Role-based access control - Reader, Contributor, Owner Individual AD Identity Interactive push/pull by developers and testers Admin user Interactive push/pull by individual developers and testers By default, disabled. <p>Individual login with Azure AD</p> <p>When working with your registry directly, such as pulling images to and pushing images from a development workstation, authenticate by using the az acr login command in the Azure CLI. When you log in with az acr login, the CLI uses the token created when you executed az login to seamlessly authenticate your session with your registry. To complete the authentication flow, Docker must be installed and running in your environment. az acr login uses the Docker client to set an Azure Active Directory token in the docker.config file. Once you've logged in this way, your credentials are cached, and subsequent docker commands in your session do not require a username or password.</p> <p>Service principal</p> <p>If you assign a service principal to your registry, your application or service can use it for headless authentication. Service principals allow role-based access to a registry, and you can assign multiple service principals to a registry. Multiple service principals allow you to define different access for different applications.</p> <p>The available roles for a container registry include:</p> <ul> <li>AcrPull: pull</li> <li>AcrPush: pull and push</li> <li>Owner: pull, push, and assign roles to other users</li> </ul> <p>Admin account</p> <p>Each container registry includes an admin user account, which is disabled by default. You can enable the admin user and manage its credentials in the Azure portal, or by using the Azure CLI or other Azure tools. The admin account is provided with two passwords, both of which can be regenerated. Two passwords allow you to maintain connection to the registry by using one password while you regenerate the other. If the admin account is enabled, you can pass the username and either password to the docker login command when prompted for basic authentication to the registry.</p> <p>Review Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)</p> <p>As application development moves towards a container-based approach, the need to orchestrate and manage resources is important. Kubernetes is the leading platform that provides the ability to provide reliable scheduling of fault-tolerant application workloads. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a managed Kubernetes offering that further simplifies container-based application deployment and management.</p> <p>Kubernetes is ...</p> <p>Kubernetes is a rapidly evolving platform that manages container-based applications and their associated networking and storage components. The focus is on the application workloads, not the underlying infrastructure components. Kubernetes provides a declarative approach to deployments, backed by a robust set of APIs for management operations.</p> <p>You can build and run modern, portable, microservices-based applications that benefit from Kubernetes orchestrating and managing the availability of those application components. Kubernetes supports both stateless and stateful applications as teams progress through the adoption of microservices-based applications. Deployment of containers As an open platform, Kubernetes allows you to build your applications with your preferred programming language, OS, libraries, or messaging bus. Existing continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) tools can integrate with Kubernetes to schedule and deploy releases.</p> <p>Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) provides a managed Kubernetes service that reduces the complexity for deployment and core management tasks, including coordinating upgrades. The AKS control plane is managed by the Azure platform, and you only pay for the AKS nodes that run your applications. AKS is built on top of the open-source Azure Kubernetes Service Engine (aks-engine).</p> <p>Kubernetes cluster architecture</p> <p>A Kubernetes cluster is divided into two components:</p> <ul> <li>Control plane nodes provide the core Kubernetes services and orchestration of application workloads.</li> <li>Nodes run your application workloads.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Features of Azure Kubernetes Service</p> <ul> <li>Fully managed</li> <li>Public IP and FQDN (Private IP option)</li> <li>Accessed with RBAC or Azure AD</li> <li>Deployment of containers</li> <li>Dynamic scale containers</li> <li>Automation of rolling updates and rollbacks of containers</li> <li>Management of storage, network traffic, and sensitive information</li> </ul> <p>Implement an Azure Kubernetes Service architecture</p> <p>Kubernetes cluster architecture is a set of design recommendations for deploying your containers in a secure and managed configuration.</p> <p>Cluster master</p> <p>When you create an AKS cluster, a cluster master is automatically created and configured. This cluster master is provided as a managed Azure resource abstracted from the user. There is no cost for the cluster master, only the nodes that are part of the AKS cluster.</p> <p>The cluster master includes the following core Kubernetes components:</p> <ul> <li>kube-apiserver - The API server is how the underlying Kubernetes APIs are exposed. This component provides the interaction for management tools, such as kubectl or the Kubernetes dashboard.</li> <li>etcd - To maintain the state of your Kubernetes cluster and configuration, the highly available etcd is a key value store within Kubernetes.</li> <li>kube-scheduler - When you create or scale applications, the Scheduler determines what nodes can run the workload and starts them.</li> <li>kube-controller-manager - The Controller Manager oversees a number of smaller Controllers that perform actions such as replicating pods and handling node operations.</li> </ul> <p>AKS provides a single-tenant cluster master, with a dedicated API server, Scheduler, etc. You define the number and size of the nodes, and the Azure platform configures the secure communication between the cluster master and nodes. Interaction with the cluster master occurs through Kubernetes APIs, such as kubectl or the Kubernetes dashboard.</p> <p>This managed cluster master means that you do not need to configure components like a highly available store, but it also means that you cannot access the cluster master directly. Upgrades to Kubernetes are orchestrated through the Azure CLI or Azure portal, which upgrades the cluster master and then the nodes. To troubleshoot possible issues, you can review the cluster master logs through Azure Log Analytics.</p> <p>If you need to configure the cluster master in a particular way or need direct access to them, you can deploy your own Kubernetes cluster using aks-engine.</p> <p>Nodes and node pools</p> <p>To run your applications and supporting services, you need a Kubernetes node. An AKS cluster has one or more nodes, which is an Azure virtual machine (VM) that runs the Kubernetes node components and container runtime:</p> <ul> <li>The kubelet is the Kubernetes agent that processes the orchestration requests from the control plane and scheduling of running the requested containers.</li> <li>Virtual networking is handled by the kube-proxy on each node. The proxy routes network traffic and manages IP addressing for services and pods.</li> <li>The container runtime is the component that allows containerized applications to run and interact with additional resources such as the virtual network and storage. In AKS, Moby is used as the container runtime.</li> </ul> <p>The Azure VM size for your nodes defines how many CPUs, how much memory, and the size and type of storage available (such as high-performance SSD or regular HDD). If you anticipate a need for applications that require large amounts of CPU and memory or high-performance storage, plan the node size accordingly. You can also scale out the number of nodes in your AKS cluster to meet demand.</p> <p>In AKS, the VM image for the nodes in your cluster is currently based on Ubuntu Linux or Windows Server 2019. When you create an AKS cluster or scale out the number of nodes, the Azure platform creates the requested number of VMs and configures them. There's no manual configuration for you to perform. Agent nodes are billed as standard virtual machines, so any discounts you have on the VM size you're using (including Azure reservations) are automatically applied.</p> <p>If you need to use a different host OS, container runtime, or include custom packages, you can deploy your own Kubernetes cluster using aks-engine. The upstream aks-engine releases features and provides configuration options before they are officially supported in AKS clusters. For example, if you wish to use a container runtime other than Moby, you can use aks-engine to configure and deploy a Kubernetes cluster that meets your current needs.</p> <p>Cluster master nodes provide the core Kubernetes services and orchestration of application workloads. Nodes (virtual machines) run your application workloads.</p> <p>AKS Terminology</p> Term Description Pools Group   of nodes with identical configuration Node Individual   VM running containerized applications Pods Single   instance of an application. A pod can contain multiple containers Deployment One   or more identical pods managed by Kubernetes Manifest YAML   file describing a deployment <p>Master security</p> <p>In AKS, the Kubernetes master components are part of the managed service provided by Microsoft. Each AKS cluster has its own single-tenanted, dedicated Kubernetes master to provide the API Server, Scheduler, etc. This master is managed and maintained by Microsoft.</p> <p>By default, the Kubernetes API server uses a public IP address and a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). You can control access to the API server using Kubernetes role-based access controls and Azure Active Directory.</p> <p>Node security</p> <p>AKS nodes are Azure virtual machines that you manage and maintain. Linux nodes run an optimized Ubuntu distribution using the Moby container runtime. Windows Server nodes run an optimized Windows Server 2019 release and also use the Moby container runtime. When an AKS cluster is created or scaled up, the nodes are automatically deployed with the latest OS security updates and configurations.</p> <p>The Azure platform automatically applies OS security patches to Linux nodes on a nightly basis. If a Linux OS security update requires a host reboot, that reboot is not automatically performed. You can manually reboot the Linux nodes, or a common approach is to use Kured, an open-source reboot daemon for Kubernetes. Kured runs as a DaemonSet and monitors each node for the presence of a file indicating that a reboot is required. Reboots are managed across the cluster using the same cordon and drain process as a cluster upgrade.</p> <p>For Windows Server nodes, Windows Update does not automatically run and apply the latest updates. On a regular schedule around the Windows Update release cycle and your own validation process, you should perform an upgrade on the Windows Server node pool(s) in your AKS cluster. This upgrade process creates nodes that run the latest Windows Server image and patches, then removes the older nodes. Nodes are deployed into a private virtual network subnet, with no public IP addresses assigned. For troubleshooting and management purposes, SSH is enabled by default. This SSH access is only available using the internal IP address.</p> <p>To provide storage, the nodes use Azure Managed Disks. For most VM node sizes, these are Premium disks backed by high-performance SSDs. The data stored on managed disks is automatically encrypted at rest within the Azure platform. To improve redundancy, these disks are also securely replicated within the Azure datacenter.</p> <p>Kubernetes environments, in AKS or elsewhere, currently aren't completely safe for hostile multi-tenant usage. Additional security features such as Pod Security Policies or more fine-grained role-based access controls (RBAC) for nodes make exploits more difficult. However, for true security when running hostile multi-tenant workloads, a hypervisor is the only level of security that you should trust. The security domain for Kubernetes becomes the entire cluster, not an individual node. For these types of hostile multi-tenant workloads, you should use physically isolated clusters.</p> <p>To protect your customer data as you run application workloads in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), the security of your cluster is a key consideration.</p> <p>Configure Azure Kubernetes Service networking</p> <p>To allow access to your applications, or for application components to communicate with each other, Kubernetes provides an abstraction layer to virtual networking. Kubernetes nodes are connected to a virtual network, and can provide inbound and outbound connectivity for pods. The kube-proxy component runs on each node to provide these network features.</p> <p>In Kubernetes, Services logically group pods to allow for direct access via an IP address or DNS name and on a specific port. You can also distribute traffic using a load balancer. More complex routing of application traffic can also be achieved with Ingress Controllers. Security and filtering of the network traffic for pods is possible with Kubernetes network policies.</p> <p>The Azure platform also helps to simplify virtual networking for AKS clusters. When you create a Kubernetes load balancer, the underlying Azure load balancer resource is created and configured. As you open network ports to pods, the corresponding Azure network security group rules are configured. For HTTP application routing, Azure can also configure external DNS as new ingress routes are configured.</p> <p>Services</p> <p>To simplify the network configuration for application workloads, Kubernetes uses Services to logically group a set of pods together and provide network connectivity. The following Service types are available:</p> <ul> <li>Cluster IP - Creates an internal IP address for use within the AKS cluster. Good for internal-only applications that support other workloads within the cluster.</li> <li>NodePort - Creates a port mapping on the underlying node that allows the application to be accessed directly with the node IP address and port.</li> <li>LoadBalancer - Creates an Azure load balancer resource, configures an external IP address, and connects the requested pods to the load balancer backend pool. To allow customers' traffic to reach the application, load balancing rules are created on the desired ports.</li> <li>ExternalName - Creates a specific DNS entry for easier application access.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>When you run modern, microservices-based applications in Kubernetes, you often want to control which components can communicate with each other. The principle of least privilege should be applied to how traffic can flow between pods in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. Let's say you likely want to block traffic directly to back-end applications. The Network Policy feature in Kubernetes lets you define rules for ingress and egress traffic between pods in a cluster.</p> <p>Deploy Azure Kubernetes Service storage</p> <p>Applications that run in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) may need to store and retrieve data. For some application workloads, this data storage can use local, fast storage on the node that is no longer needed when the pods are deleted. Other application workloads may require storage that persists on more regular data volumes within the Azure platform. Multiple pods may need to share the same data volumes, or reattach data volumes if the pod is rescheduled on a different node. Finally, you may need to inject sensitive data or application configuration information into pods.</p> <p></p> <p>Volumes</p> <p>Applications often need to be able to store and retrieve data. As Kubernetes typically treats individual pods as ephemeral, disposable resources, different approaches are available for applications to use and persist data as necessary. A volume represents a way to store, retrieve, and persist data across pods and through the application lifecycle.</p> <p>Traditional volumes to store and retrieve data are created as Kubernetes resources backed by Azure Storage. You can manually create these data volumes to be assigned to pods directly, or have Kubernetes automatically create them. These data volumes can use Azure Disks or Azure Files:</p> <ul> <li>Azure Disks can be used to create a Kubernetes DataDisk resource. Disks can use Azure Premium storage, backed by high-performance SSDs, or Azure Standard storage, backed by regular HDDs. For most production and development workloads, use Premium storage. Azure Disks are mounted as ReadWriteOnce, so are only available to a single pod. For storage volumes that can be accessed by multiple pods simultaneously, use Azure Files.</li> <li>Azure Files can be used to mount an SMB 3.0 share backed by an Azure Storage account to pods. Files let you share data across multiple nodes and pods. Files can use Azure Standard storage backed by regular HDDs, or Azure Premium storage, backed by high-performance SSDs.</li> </ul> <p>Persistent volumes</p> <p>Volumes that are defined and created as part of the pod lifecycle only exist until the pod is deleted. Pods often expect their storage to remain if a pod is rescheduled on a different host during a maintenance event, especially in StatefulSets. A persistent volume (PV) is a storage resource created and managed by the Kubernetes API that can exist beyond the lifetime of an individual pod.</p> <p>Azure Disks or Files are used to provide the PersistentVolume. As noted in the previous section on Volumes, the choice of Disks or Files is often determined by the need for concurrent access to the data or the performance tier.</p> <p>A PersistentVolume can be statically created by a cluster administrator, or dynamically created by the Kubernetes API server. If a pod is scheduled and requests storage that is not currently available, Kubernetes can create the underlying Azure Disk or Files storage and attach it to the pod. Dynamic provisioning uses a StorageClass to identify what type of Azure storage needs to be created</p> <p>Storage classes</p> <p>To define different tiers of storage, such as Premium and Standard, you can create a StorageClass. The StorageClass also defines the reclaimPolicy. This reclaimPolicy controls the behavior of the underlying Azure storage resource when the pod is deleted and the persistent volume may no longer be required. The underlying storage resource can be deleted, or retained for use with a future pod.</p> <p>In AKS, two initial StorageClasses are created:</p> <ul> <li>default - Uses Azure Standard storage to create a Managed Disk. The reclaim policy indicates that the underlying Azure Disk is deleted when the persistent volume that used it is deleted.</li> <li>managed-premium - Uses Azure Premium storage to create Managed Disk. The reclaim policy again indicates that the underlying Azure Disk is deleted when the persistent volume that used it is deleted.</li> </ul> <p>If no StorageClass is specified for a persistent volume, the default StorageClass is used.</p> <p>Persistent volume claims</p> <p>A PersistentVolumeClaim requests either Disk or File storage of a particular StorageClass, access mode, and size. The Kubernetes API server can dynamically provision the underlying storage resource in Azure if there is no existing resource to fulfill the claim based on the defined StorageClass. The pod definition includes the volume mount once the volume has been connected to the pod.</p> <p></p> <p>A PersistentVolume is bound to a PersistentVolumeClaim once an available storage resource has been assigned to the pod requesting it. There is a 1:1 mapping of persistent volumes to claims.</p> <p>Secure authentication to Azure Kubernetes Service with Active Directory\u200b</p> <p>There are different ways to authenticate with and secure Kubernetes clusters. Using role-based access controls (RBAC), you can grant users or groups access to only the resources they need. With Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you can further enhance the security and permissions structure by using Azure Active Directory. These approaches help you secure your application workloads and customer data.</p> <p>Kubernetes service accounts</p> <p>One of the primary user types in Kubernetes is a service account. A service account exists and is managed by, the Kubernetes API. The credentials for service accounts are stored as Kubernetes secrets, which allows them to be used by authorized pods to communicate with the API Server. Most API requests provide an authentication token for a service account or a normal user account.</p> <p>Normal user accounts allow more traditional access for human administrators or developers, not just services and processes. Kubernetes itself doesn't provide an identity management solution where regular user accounts and passwords are stored. Instead, external identity solutions can be integrated into Kubernetes. For AKS clusters, this integrated identity solution is Azure Active Directory.</p> <p>Azure Active Directory integration</p> <p>The security of AKS clusters can be enhanced with the integration of Azure Active Directory (AD). Built on decades of enterprise identity management, Azure AD is a multi-tenant, cloud-based directory, and identity management service that combines core directory services, application access management, and identity protection. With Azure AD, you can integrate on-premises identities into AKS clusters to provide a single source for account management and security.</p> <p></p> <p>With Azure AD-integrated AKS clusters, you can grant users or groups access to Kubernetes resources within a namespace or across the cluster. To obtain a Kubectl configuration context, a user can run the az aks get-credentials command. When a user then interacts with the AKS cluster with kubectl, they are prompted to sign in with their Azure AD credentials. This approach provides a single source for user account management and password credentials. The user can only access the resources as defined by the cluster administrator.</p> <p>Azure AD authentication in AKS clusters uses OpenID Connect, an identity layer built on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. OAuth 2.0 defines mechanisms to obtain and use access tokens to access protected resources, and OpenID Connect implements authentication as an extension to the OAuth 2.0 authorization process.</p> <p>Manage access to Azure Kubernetes Service using Azure role-based access controls</p> <p>One additional mechanism for controlling access to resources is Azure role-based access controls (RBAC). Kubernetes RBAC is designed to work on resources within your AKS cluster, and Azure RBAC is designed to work on resources within your Azure subscription. With Azure RBAC, you create a role definition that outlines the permissions to be applied. A user or group is then assigned this role definition for a particular scope, which could be an individual resource, a resource group, or across the subscription.</p> <p>Roles and ClusterRoles</p> <p>Before you assign permissions to users with Kubernetes RBAC, you first define those permissions as a Role. Kubernetes roles grant permissions. There is no concept of a deny permission.</p> <p>Roles are used to grant permissions within a namespace. If you need to grant permissions across the entire cluster, or to cluster resources outside a given namespace, you can instead use ClusterRoles.</p> <p>A ClusterRole works in the same way to grant permissions to resources, but can be applied to resources across the entire cluster, not a specific namespace.</p> <p>RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings Once roles are defined to grant permissions to resources, you assign those Kubernetes RBAC permissions with a RoleBinding. If your AKS cluster integrates with Azure Active Directory, bindings are how those Azure AD users are granted permissions to perform actions within the cluster.</p> <p>Role bindings are used to assign roles for a given namespace. This approach lets you logically segregate a single AKS cluster, with users only able to access the application resources in their assigned namespace. If you need to bind roles across the entire cluster, or to cluster resources outside a given namespace, you can instead use ClusterRoleBindings.</p> <p>A ClusterRoleBinding works in the same way to bind roles to users, but can be applied to resources across the entire cluster, not a specific namespace. This approach lets you grant administrators or support engineers access to all resources in the AKS cluster.</p> <p>Kubernetes Secrets A Kubernetes Secret is used to inject sensitive data into pods, such as access credentials or keys. You first create a Secret using the Kubernetes API. When you define your pod or deployment, a specific Secret can be requested. Secrets are only provided to nodes that have a scheduled pod that requires it, and the Secret is stored in tmpfs, not written to disk. When the last pod on a node that requires a Secret is deleted, the Secret is deleted from the node's tmpfs. Secrets are stored within a given namespace and can only be accessed by pods within the same namespace.</p> <p>The use of Secrets reduces the sensitive information that is defined in the pod or service YAML manifest. Instead, you request the Secret stored in Kubernetes API Server as part of your YAML manifest. This approach only provides the specific pod access to the Secret. Please note: the raw secret manifest files contains the secret data in base64 format. Therefore, this file should be treated as sensitive information, and never committed to source control.</p> <p>Windows containers Secrets are written in clear text on the node\u2019s volume (as compared to tmpfs/in-memory on linux).

You then continue to administer these resources.</li> </ul> <p>With Azure AD DS, the core service components are deployed and maintained for you by Microsoft as a managed domain experience.

Applications, services, and VMs in Azure that connect to the managed domain can then use common AD DS features such as domain join, group policy, LDAP, and Kerberos/NTLM authentication.</p> <p>In a hybrid environment with an on-premises AD DS environment, Azure AD Connect synchronizes identity information with Azure AD, which is then synchronized to the managed domain.</p> <p></p> <p>Azure AD DS replicates identity information from Azure AD, so it works with Azure AD tenants that are cloud-only or synchronized with an on-premises AD DS environment. The same set of Azure AD DS features exists for both environments.</p> <ul> <li>If you have an existing on-premises AD DS environment, you can synchronize user account information to provide a consistent identity for users.</li> <li>For cloud-only environments, you don't need a traditional on-premises AD DS environment to use the centralized identity services of Azure AD DS.</li> </ul> <p>You can expand a managed domain to have more than one replica set per Azure AD tenant. Replica sets can be added to any peered virtual network in any Azure region that supports Azure AD DS. Additional replica sets in different Azure regions provide geographical disaster recovery for legacy applications if an Azure region goes offline.</p>"},{"location":"Cloud/Azure/AZ-500/Manage-Identity-and-Access.html#azure-ad-ds-features-and-benefits","title":"Azure AD DS features and benefits","text":"<p>To provide identity services to applications and VMs in the cloud, Azure AD DS is fully compatible with a traditional AD DS environment for operations such as domain-join, secure LDAP (LDAPS), Group Policy, DNS management, and LDAP bind and read support. LDAP write support is available for objects created in the managed domain but not resources synchronized from Azure AD.</p> <p>The following features of Azure AD DS simplify deployment and management operations:</p> <ul> <li>Simplified deployment experience: Azure AD DS is enabled for your Azure AD tenant using a single wizard in the Azure portal. </li> <li>Integrated with Azure AD: User accounts, group memberships, and credentials are automatically available from your Azure AD tenant. New users, groups, or changes to attributes from your Azure AD tenant or your on-premises AD DS environment are automatically synchronized to Azure AD DS.<ul> <li>Accounts in external directories linked to your Azure AD aren't available in Azure AD DS. Credentials aren't available for those external directories, so they can't be synchronized into a managed domain.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Use your corporate credentials/passwords: Passwords for users in Azure AD DS are the same as in your Azure AD tenant. Users can use their corporate credentials to domain-join machines, sign in interactively or over a remote desktop, and authenticate against the managed domain.</li> <li>NTLM and Kerberos authentication: With support for NTLM and Kerberos authentication, you can deploy applications that rely on Windows-integrated authentication.</li> <li>High availability: Azure AD DS includes multiple domain controllers, which provide high availability for your managed domain. This high availability guarantees service uptime and resilience to failures.<ul> <li>In regions that support Azure Availability Zones, these domain controllers are distributed across zones for additional resiliency.</li> <li>Replica sets can also be used to provide geographical disaster recovery for legacy applications if an Azure region goes offline.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Some key aspects of a managed domain include the following:    - The managed domain is a stand-alone domain.

Then we leverage that information in conditional access policy to be able to enforce things like multifactor authentication or require a compliant device.</p> <p>There are the conditions, which indicate when the policy is going to apply. This can be, again, the location, type of application that you\u2019re on, any detected risk. How is the risk determined? It is determined from all the analysis and intel that we have across organizations using Azure Active Directory, as well as Microsoft consumer identity offerings. Conditional Access is the tool used by Azure Active Directory to bring signals together, to make decisions, and enforce organizational policies. Conditional Access policies at their simplest are if-then statements, if a user wants to access a resource, then they must complete an action. Example: A payroll manager wants to access the payroll application and is required to perform multifactor authentication to access it.</p> <p>Administrators are faced with two primary goals:</p> <ul> <li>Empower users to be productive wherever and whenever</li> <li>Protect the organization's assets</li> </ul> <p>By using Conditional Access policies, you can apply the right access controls when needed to keep your organization secure and stay out of your user\u2019s way when not needed.</p> <p></p> <p>Conditional Access policies are enforced after the first-factor authentication has been completed. Conditional Access is not intended as an organization's first line of defense for scenarios like denial-of-service (DoS) attacks but can use signals from these events to determine access.</p>"},{"location":"Cloud/Azure/AZ-500/Manage-Identity-and-Access.html#configure-conditional-access-conditions","title":"Configure conditional access conditions","text":"<p>Conditional access is a capability of Azure AD (with an Azure AD Premium license) that enables you to enforce controls on the access to apps in your environment based on specific conditions from a central location.

These policies enforce different rules and effects over your resources so that those resources stay compliant with your corporate standards and service level agreements. Azure Policy meets this need by evaluating your resources for noncompliance with assigned policies. For example, you might have a policy that allows virtual machines of only a certain size in your environment. After this policy is implemented, new and existing resources are evaluated for compliance. With the right type of policy, existing resources can be brought into compliance.</p> <p>There are three main pillars in the functionalities of Azure policy.</p> <p></p> <p>The first pillar is around real-time enforcement and compliance assessment. For example, a policy would block the creation of resources that are located outside of US regions. Each policy also provides compliance assessment on all your existing resources to bring a state of compliance for each resource. The data then powers the compliance view which aggregates results across all of the applied policies. Policies can be used to ensure that resource groups are getting tagged properly and automatically inheriting those tags from the resource group down to the resources.</p> <p>The second pillar of policy is applying policies at scale by leveraging Management Groups. By assigning policy to a management group one can impact hundreds of subscriptions and all its reach resources through a single policy assignment. There also is the concept called policy initiative that allows you to group policies together so that you can view the aggregated compliance result. At the initiative level there's also a concept called exclusion where one can exclude either the child management group subscription resource group or resources from the policy assignment.</p> <p>The third pillar of your policy is remediation by leveraging a remediation policy that will automatically remediate the non-compliant resource so that your environment always stays compliant.

Azure AD and Role Based Access Control (RBAC) make it simple for you to carry out these goals. After you extend your on-premises Active Directory to the cloud by using Azure AD Connect, your employees can use and manage their Azure subscriptions by using their existing work identities. These Azure subscriptions automatically connect to Azure AD for SSO and access management. When you disable an on-premises Active Directory account, it automatically loses access to all Azure subscriptions connected with Azure AD.</p> <p>Additionally, synchronizing passwords to the cloud to support these checks also add resiliency during some attacks. Customers affected by (Not)Petya attacks were able to continue business operations when password hashes were synced to Azure AD (vs. near zero communications and IT services for customers affected organizations that had not synchronized passwords).</p> <p>RBAC enables fine-grained access management for Azure. Using RBAC, you can grant just the amount of access that users need to perform their jobs. For example, you can use RBAC to let one employee manage virtual machines in a subscription while another manages SQL databases within the same subscription.</p> <p>Each Azure subscription is associated with one Azure AD directory. Users, groups, and applications in that directory can manage resources in the Azure subscription. Grant access by assigning the appropriate RBAC role to users, groups, and applications at a certain scope. The scope of a role assignment can be a subscription, a resource group, or a single resource. A role assigned at a parent scope also grants access to the child scopes contained within it. For example, a user with access to a resource group can manage all the resources it contains, like websites, virtual machines, and subnets. The RBAC role that you assign dictates what resources the user, group, or application can manage within that scope.</p> <p>The following diagram depicts how the classic subscription administrator roles, RBAC roles, and Azure AD administrator roles are related at a high level. Roles assigned at a higher scope, like a subscription, are inherited by child scopes, like service instances.</p> <p></p> <pre><code>Important\n\nNote that a subscription is associated with only one Azure AD tenant.

Azure Policy evaluates the state by examining properties on resources that are represented in Resource Manager and properties of some Resource Providers. Azure Policy ensures that the resource state is compliant with your business rules without concern for who made the change or who has permission to make a change. Azure Policy, through the DenyAction effect, can also block specific actions on resources. Some Azure Policy resources, such as policy definitions, initiative definitions, and assignments, are visible to all users. This design enables transparency to all users and services regarding what policy rules are set in their environment.</p> <p>Azure RBAC focuses on managing user actions at different scopes. If control of an action is required based on user information, then Azure RBAC is the correct tool to use. Even if an individual has access to perform an action, if the result is a non-compliant resource, Azure Policy still blocks the create or update task.</p> <p>The combination of Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) and Azure Policy provides full-scope control in Azure.</p> <p>Azure Policy has several permissions, known as operations, in two Resource Providers:</p> <ol> <li>Microsoft.Authorization</li> <li>Microsoft.PolicyInsights</li> </ol> <p>Many built-in roles grant permission to Azure Policy resources.

Currently, the exposed security data from Microsoft Defender for Cloud to a SIEM consists of security alerts.</p> <p>Microsoft Defender for Cloud security alerts</p> <p>Microsoft Defender for Cloud automatically collects, analyzes, and integrates log data from your Azure resources; the network; and connected partner solutions, like firewall and endpoint protection solutions, to detect real threats and reduce false positives. Microsoft Defender for Cloud displays a list of prioritized security alerts along with the information you need to quickly investigate the problem and recommendations for how to remediate an attack.</p> <p>The following sections describe how you can configure data to be streamed to an event hub. The steps assume that you already have Microsoft Defender for Cloud configured in your Azure subscription.</p> <p>Azure Event Hubs</p> <p>Azure Event Hubs is a streaming platform and event ingestion service that can transform and store data by using any real-time analytics provider or batching/storage adapters. Use Event Hubs to stream log data from Azure Monitor to a Microsoft Sentinel or a partner SIEM and monitoring tools.</p> <p>What data can be sent into an event hub?</p> <p>Within your Azure environment, there are several 'tiers' of monitoring data, and the method of accessing data from each tier varies slightly. Typically, these tiers can be described as:</p> <ul> <li>Application monitoring data - Data about the performance and functionality of the code you have written and are running on Azure. Examples of application monitoring data include performance traces, application logs, and user telemetry. Application monitoring data is usually collected in one of the following ways:<ul> <li>By instrumenting your code with an SDK such as the Application Insights SDK.</li> <li>By running a monitoring agent that listens for new application logs on the machine running your application, such as the Windows Azure Diagnostic Agent or Linux Azure Diagnostic Agent.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Guest OS monitoring data - Data about the operating system on which your application is running. Examples of guest OS monitoring data would be Linux syslog or Windows system events. To collect this type of data, you need to install an agent such as the Windows Azure Diagnostic Agent or Linux Azure Diagnostic Agent.</li> <li>Azure resource monitoring data - Data about the operation of an Azure resource. For some Azure resource types, such as virtual machines, there is a guest OS and application(s) to monitor inside of that Azure service. For other Azure resources, such as Network Security Groups, the resource monitoring data is the highest tier of data available (since there is no guest OS or application running in those resources). This data can be collected using resource diagnostic settings.</li> <li>Azure subscription monitoring data - Data about the operation and management of an Azure subscription, as well as data about the health and operation of Azure itself. The activity log contains most subscription monitoring data, such as service health incidents and Azure Resource Manager audits. You can collect this data using a Log Profile.</li> <li>Azure tenant monitoring data - Data about the operation of tenant-level Azure services, such as Azure Active Directory. The Azure Active Directory audits and sign-ins are examples of tenant monitoring data. This data can be collected using a tenant diagnostic setting.</li> </ul> <p>Data from any tier can be sent into an event hub, where it can be pulled into a tool. Some sources can be configured to send data directly to an event hub while another process such as a Logic App may be required to retrieve the required data.</p> <p>Connecting to Microsoft Sentinel</p> <p>Microsoft Sentinel is now generally available. With Microsoft Sentinel, enterprises worldwide can now keep pace with the exponential growth in security data, improve security outcomes without adding analyst resources, and reduce hardware and operational costs. Microsoft Sentinel brings together the power of Azure and AI to enable Security Operations Centers to achieve more.</p> <p>Some of the features of Microsoft Sentinel are:</p> <ul> <li>More than 100 built-in alert rules<ul> <li>Sentinel's alert rule wizard to create your own.</li> <li>Alerts can be triggered by a single event or based on a threshold, or by correlating different datasets or by using built-in machine learning algorithms.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Jupyter Notebooks that use a growing collection of hunting queries, exploratory queries, and python libraries.</li> <li>Investigation graph for visualizing and traversing the connections between entities like users, assets, applications, or URLs and related activities like logins, data transfers, or application usage to rapidly understand the scope and impact of an incident.</li> </ul> <p>The Microsoft Sentinel GitHub repository has grown to over 400 detection, exploratory, and hunting queries, plus Azure Notebooks samples and related Python libraries, playbooks samples, and parsers. The bulk of these were developed by Microsoft's security researchers based on their vast global security experience and threat intelligence.</p> <p>To on-board Microsoft Sentinel, you first need to enable Microsoft Sentinel, and then connect your data sources. Microsoft Sentinel comes with a number of connectors for Microsoft solutions, available out of the box and providing real-time integration, including Microsoft Threat Protection solutions, Microsoft 365 sources, including Microsoft 365, Azure AD, Azure ATP, and Microsoft Cloud App Security, and more. In addition, there are built-in connectors to the broader security ecosystem for non-Microsoft solutions. You can also use common event format, Syslog or REST-API to connect your data sources with Azure Sentinel.</p> <p>After you connect your data sources, choose from a gallery of expertly created dashboards that surface insights based on your data. These dashboards can be easily customized to your needs.</p> <p>Configure and monitor metrics and logs</p> <p>All data that Azure Monitor collects fits into one of two fundamental types: metrics or logs.</p> <p>Azure Monitor Metrics</p> <p>Azure Monitor Metrics is a feature of Azure Monitor that collects numeric data from monitored resources into a time series database. Metrics are numerical values that are collected at regular intervals and describe some aspect of a system at a particular time.</p> <p>Azure Monitor Metrics - Navigation Example</p> <p>Use Metrics Explorer to interactively analyze the data in your metric database and chart the values of multiple metrics over time. You can pin the charts to a dashboard to view them with other visualizations. You can also retrieve metrics by using the Azure monitoring REST API.</p> <p></p> <p>Behind the scene, log-based metrics translate into log queries. Their retention matches the retention of events in underlying logs. For Application Insights resources, logs are stored for 90 days.</p> <p>Types of metrics</p> <p>There are multiple types of metrics supported by Azure Monitor Metrics:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Native metrics use tools in Azure Monitor for analysis and alerting.<ul> <li>Platform metrics are collected from Azure resources. They require no configuration and have no cost.</li> <li>Custom metrics are collected from different sources that you configure, including applications and agents running on virtual machines.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Prometheus metrics (preview) are collected from Kubernetes clusters, including Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and use industry-standard tools for analyzing and alerting, such as PromQL and Grafana.</li> </ul> <p>Additional Background and Information</p> <p>What is Prometheus? Prometheus is an open-source toolkit that collects data for monitoring and alerting.</p> <p>Prometheus Features:</p> <ul> <li>A multi-dimensional data model with time series data identified by metric name and key/value pairs</li> <li>PromQL (PromQL component called Prom Kubernetes - an extension to support Prometheus) provides a flexible query language to use this dimensionality.</li> <li>Time series collection happens via a pull model over Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</li> <li>Pushing time series is supported via an intermediary gateway</li> <li>Targets are discovered via service discovery or static configuration</li> </ul> <p>What is Azure Managed Grafana?</p> <p>Azure Managed Grafana is a data visualization platform built on top of the Grafana software by Grafana Labs. It's built as a fully managed Azure service operated and supported by Microsoft. Grafana helps you combine metrics, logs, and traces into a single user interface. With its extensive support for data sources and graphing capabilities, you can view and analyze your application and infrastructure telemetry data in real-time.</p> <p>Azure Managed Grafana is optimized for the Azure environment. It works seamlessly with many Azure services. Specifically, for the current preview, it provides with the following integration features:</p> <ul> <li>Built-in support for Azure Monitor and Azure Data Explorer</li> <li>User authentication and access control using Azure Active Directory identities</li> <li>Direct import of existing charts from the Azure portal</li> </ul> <p>Why use Azure Managed Grafana?</p> <p>Managed Grafana lets you bring together all your telemetry data into one place. It can access various data sources supported, including your data stores in Azure and elsewhere. By combining charts, logs, and alerts into one view, you can get a holistic view of your application and infrastructure and correlate information across multiple datasets.</p> <p>As a fully managed service, Azure Managed Grafana lets you deploy Grafana without having to deal with setup. The service provides high availability, service level agreement (SLA) guarantees, and automatic software updates.</p> <p>You can share Grafana dashboards with people inside and outside your organization and allow others to join in for monitoring or troubleshooting.</p> <p>Managed Grafana uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)\u2019s centralized identity management, which allows you to control which users can use a Grafana instance, and you can use managed identities to access Azure data stores, such as Azure Monitor.</p> <p>You can create dashboards instantaneously by importing existing charts directly from the Azure portal or by using prebuilt dashboards.</p> <p>The differences between each of the metrics are summarized in the following table.</p> Category Native platform metrics Native custom metrics Prometheus metrics (preview) Sources Azure resources Azure Monitor agent Application Insights Representational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API) Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster Any Kubernetes cluster through remote-write Configuration None Varies by source Enable Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus Stored Subscription Subscription Azure Monitor workspace Cost No Yes Yes (free during preview) Aggregation pre-aggregated pre-aggregated raw data Analyze Metrics Explorer Metrics Explorer Prometheus Querying (PromQL) LanguageGrafana dashboards Alert metrics alert rule metrics alert rule Prometheus alert rule Visualize WorkbooksAzure dashboardGrafana WorkbooksAzure dashboardGrafana Grafana Retrieve Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) Azure PowerShell cmdletsRepresentational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API) or client library.NETGoJavaJavaScriptPython Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) Azure PowerShell cmdletsRepresentational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API) or client library.NETGoJavaJavaScriptPython Grafana <p>Data collection</p> <p>Azure Monitor collects metrics from the following sources. After these metrics are collected in the Azure Monitor metric database, they can be evaluated together regardless of their source:</p> <ul> <li>Azure resources: Platform metrics are created by Azure resources and give you visibility into their health and performance. Each type of resource creates a distinct set of metrics without any configuration required. Platform metrics are collected from Azure resources at a one-minute frequency unless specified otherwise in the metric's definition.</li> <li>Applications: Application Insights creates metrics for your monitored applications to help you detect performance issues and track trends in how your application is used. Values include Server response time and Browser exceptions.</li> <li>Virtual machine agents: Metrics are collected from the guest operating system of a virtual machine. You can enable guest operating system (OS) metrics for Windows virtual machines using the Windows diagnostic extension and Linux virtual machines by using the InfluxData Telegraf agent.</li> <li>Custom metrics: You can define metrics in addition to the standard metrics that are automatically available. You can define custom metrics in your application that are monitored by Application Insights. You can also create custom metrics for an Azure service by using the custom metrics Application Programming Interface (API).</li> <li>Kubernetes clusters: Kubernetes clusters typically send metric data to a local Prometheus server that you must maintain. Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus provides a managed service that collects metrics from Kubernetes clusters and stores them in Azure Monitor Metrics.</li> </ul> <p>A common type of log entry is an event, which is collected sporadically. Events are created by an application or service and typically include enough information to provide complete context on their own. For example, an event can indicate that a particular resource was created or modified, a new host started in response to increased traffic, or an error was detected in an application.</p> <p>Because the format of the data can vary, applications can create custom logs by using the structure that they need. Metric data can even be stored in Logs to combine them with other monitoring data for trending and other data analysis.</p> <p>The following is a list of the different ways that you can use Logs in Azure Monitor.</p> <ul> <li>Analyze - Use Log Analytics in the Azure portal to write log queries and interactively analyze log data using the powerful Data Explorer analysis engine. Use the Application Insights analytics console in the Azure portal to write log queries and interactively analyze log data from Application Insights.</li> <li>Visualize - Pin query results rendered as tables or charts to an Azure dashboard. Create a workbook to combine with multiple sets of data in an interactive report. Export the results of a query to Power BI to use different visualizations and share with users outside of Azure. Export the results of a query to Grafana to use its dashboarding and combine with other data sources.</li> <li>Alert - Configure a log alert rule that sends a notification or takes automated action when the results of the query match a particular result. Configure a metric alert rule on certain log data logs extracted as metrics.</li> <li>Retrieve - Access log query results from a command line using Azure command-line interface (CLI). Access log query results from a command line using PowerShell cmdlets. Access log query results from a custom application using Representational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API).</li> <li>Export - Build a workflow to retrieve log data and copy it to an external location using Logic Apps.</li> </ul> <p>Log queries</p> <p>Data in Azure Monitor Logs is retrieved using a log query written with the Kusto query language, which allows you to quickly retrieve, consolidate, and analyze collected data. Use Log Analytics to write and test log queries in the Azure portal. It allows you to work with results interactively or pin them to a dashboard to view them with other visualizations.</p> <p></p> <p>Security tools use of Monitor logs</p> <ul> <li>Microsoft Defender for Cloud stores data that it collects in a Log Analytics workspace where it can be analyzed with other log data.</li> <li>Azure Sentinel stores data from data sources into a Log Analytics workspace.</li> </ul> <p>Enable Log Analytics</p> <p>Log Analytics is part of Microsoft Azure's overall monitoring solution. Log Analytics helps you monitors cloud and on-premises environments to maintain availability and performance.</p> <p>Log Analytics is the primary tool in the Azure portal for writing log queries and interactively analyzing their results. Even if a log query is used elsewhere in Azure Monitor, you'll typically write and test the query first using Log Analytics.</p> <p>You can start Log Analytics from several places in the Azure portal. The scope of the data available to Log Analytics is determined by how you start it.</p> <ul> <li>Select Logs from the Azure Monitor menu or Log Analytics workspaces menu.</li> <li>Select Analytics from the Overview page of an Application Insights application.</li> <li>Select Logs from the menu of an Azure resource.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>In addition to interactively working with log queries and their results in Log Analytics, areas in Azure Monitor where you will use queries include the following:</p> <ul> <li>Alert rules. Alert rules proactively identify issues from data in your workspace. Each alert rule is based on a log search that is automatically run at regular intervals. The results are inspected to determine if an alert should be created.</li> <li>Dashboards. You can pin the results of any query into an Azure dashboard which allow you to visualize log and metric data together and optionally share with other Azure users.</li> <li>Views. You can create visualizations of data to be included in user dashboards with View Designer. Log queries provide the data used by tiles and visualization parts in each view.</li> <li>Export. When you import log data from Azure Monitor into Excel or Power BI, you create a log query to define the data to export.</li> <li>PowerShell. Use the results of a log query in a PowerShell script from a command line or an Azure Automation runbook that uses Invoke-AzOperationalInsightsQuery.</li> <li>Azure Monitor Logs API. The Azure Monitor Logs API allows any REST API client to retrieve log data from the workspace. The API request includes a query that is run against Azure Monitor to determine the data to retrieve.</li> </ul> <p>At the center of Log Analytics is the Log Analytics workspace, which is hosted in Azure. Log Analytics collects data in the workspace from connected sources by configuring data sources and adding solutions to your subscription. Data sources and solutions each create different record types, each with its own set of properties. But you can still analyze sources and solutions together in queries to the workspace. This capability allows you to use the same tools and methods to work with a variety of data collected by a variety of sources.</p> <p>Use the Log Analytics workspaces menu to create a Log Analytics workspace using the Azure portal. A Log Analytics workspace is a unique environment for Azure Monitor log data. Each workspace has its own data repository and configuration, and data sources and solutions are configured to store their data in a particular workspace. You require a Log Analytics workspace if you intend on collecting data from the following sources:</p> <ul> <li>Azure resources in your subscription</li> <li>On-premises computers monitored by System Center Operations Manager</li> <li>Device collections from Configuration Manager</li> <li>Diagnostics or log data from Azure storage</li> </ul> <p>Manage connected sources for log analytics</p> <p>The Azure Log Analytics agent was developed for comprehensive management across virtual machines in any cloud, on-premises machines, and those monitored by System Center Operations Manager. The Windows and Linux agents send collected data from different sources to your Log Analytics workspace in Azure Monitor, as well as any unique logs or metrics as defined in a monitoring solution. The Log Analytics agent also supports insights and other services in Azure Monitor such as Azure Monitor for VMs, Microsoft Defender for Cloud, and Azure Automation.</p> <p>Comparison to Azure diagnostics extension</p> <p>The Azure diagnostics extension in Azure Monitor can also be used to collect monitoring data from the guest operating system of Azure virtual machines. You may choose to use either or both depending on your requirements.</p> <p>The key differences to consider are:</p> <ul> <li>Azure Diagnostics Extension can be used only with Azure virtual machines. The Log Analytics agent can be used with virtual machines in Azure, other clouds, and on-premises.</li> <li>Azure Diagnostics extension sends data to Azure Storage, Azure Monitor Metrics (Windows only) and Event Hubs. The Log Analytics agent collects data to Azure Monitor Logs.</li> <li>The Log Analytics agent is required for solutions, Azure Monitor for VMs, and other services such as Microsoft Defender for Cloud.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Data destinations</p> <p>The Log Analytics agent sends data to a Log Analytics workspace in Azure Monitor. The Windows agent can be multihomed to send data to multiple workspaces and System Center Operations Manager management groups. The Linux agent can send to only a single destination.</p> <p>Other services</p> <p>The agent for Linux and Windows isn't only for connecting to Azure Monitor, it also supports Azure Automation to host the Hybrid Runbook worker role and other services such as Change Tracking, Update Management, and Microsoft Defender for Cloud.</p> <p>Enable Azure monitor Alerts</p> <p>As discussed already, Azure monitor has metrics, logging, and analytics features. Another feature is Monitor Alerts.</p> <p>Responding to critical situations</p> <p>In addition to allowing you to interactively analyze monitoring data, an effective monitoring solution must be able to proactively respond to critical conditions identified in the data that it collects. This could be sending a text or mail to an administrator responsible for investigating an issue. Or you could launch an automated process that attempts to correct an error condition.</p> <p>Alerts</p> <p>Alerts in Azure Monitor proactively notify you of critical conditions and potentially attempt to take corrective action. Alert rules based on metrics provide near real time alerting based on numeric values, while rules based on logs allow for complex logic across data from multiple sources.</p> <p>Alert rules in Azure Monitor use action groups, which contain unique sets of recipients and actions that can be shared across multiple rules. Based on your requirements, action groups can perform such actions as using webhooks to have alerts start external actions or to integrate with your ITSM tools.</p> <p>The unified alert experience in Azure Monitor includes alerts that were previously managed by Log Analytics and Application Insights. In the past, Azure Monitor, Application Insights, Log Analytics, and Service Health had separate alerting capabilities. Over time, Azure improved and combined both the user interface and different methods of alerting. The consolidation is still in process.</p> <p>Overview of Alerts in Azure</p> <p>The diagram below represents the flow of alerts.</p> <p></p> <p>Alert rules are separated from alerts and the actions taken when an alert fires. The alert rule captures the target and criteria for alerting. The alert rule can be in an enabled or a disabled state. Alerts only fire when enabled.</p> <p>The following are key attributes of an alert rule as shown:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Target Resource: Defines the scope and signals available for alerting. A target can be any Azure resource. Example targets: a virtual machine, a storage account, a virtual machine scale set, a Log Analytics workspace, or an Application Insights resource. For certain resources (like virtual machines), you can specify multiple resources as the target of the alert rule.</li> <li>Signal: Emitted by the target resource. Signals can be of the following types: metric, activity log, Application Insights, and log.</li> <li>Criteria: A combination of signal and logic applied on a target resource. Examples:<ul> <li>Percentage CPU &gt; 70%</li> <li>Server Response Time &gt; 4 ms</li> <li>Result count of a log query &gt; 100</li> </ul> </li> <li>Alert Name: A specific name for the alert rule configured by the user.</li> <li>Alert Description: A description for the alert rule configured by the user.</li> <li>Severity: The severity of the alert after the criteria specified in the alert rule is met. Severity can range from 0 to 4.<ul> <li>Sev 0 = Critical</li> <li>Sev 1 = Error</li> <li>Sev 2 = Warning</li> <li>Sev 3 = Informational</li> <li>Sev 4 = Verbose</li> </ul> </li> <li>Action: A specific action taken when the alert is fired.</li> </ul> <p>What You Can Alert On</p> <p>You can alert on metrics and logs. These include but are not limited to:    - Metric values    - Log search queries    - Activity log events    - Health of the underlying Azure platform    - Tests for website availability</p> <p>With the consolidation of alerting services still in process, there are some alerting capabilities that are not yet in the new alerts system.</p> Monitor source Signal type Description Service health Activity log Not supported. View Create activity log alerts on service notifications. Application Insights Web availability tests Not supported. View Web test alerts. Available to any website that's instrumented to send data to Application Insights. Receive a notification when availability or responsiveness of a website is below expectations. <p>Configure properties for diagnostic logging</p> <p>Azure Monitor diagnostic logs are logs produced by an Azure service that provide rich, frequently collected data about the operation of that service. Azure Monitor makes two types of diagnostic logs available:</p> <ul> <li>Tenant logs. These logs come from tenant-level services that exist outside an Azure subscription, such as Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).</li> <li>Resource logs. These logs come from Azure services that deploy resources within an Azure subscription, such as Network Security Groups (NSGs) or storage accounts.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>The content of these logs varies by Azure service and resource type. For example, NSG rule counters and Azure Key Vault audits are two types of diagnostic logs.</p> <p>These logs differ from the activity log. The activity log provides insight into the operations, such as creating a VM or deleting a logic app, that Azure Resource Manager performed on resources in your subscription using. The activity log is a subscription-level log. Resource-level diagnostic logs provide insight into operations that were performed within that resource itself, such as getting a secret from a key vault.</p> <p>These logs also differ from guest operating system (OS)\u2013level diagnostic logs. Guest OS diagnostic logs are those collected by an agent running inside a VM or other supported resource type. Resource-level diagnostic logs require no agent and capture resource-specific data from the Azure platform itself, whereas guest OS\u2013level diagnostic logs capture data from the OS and applications running on a VM.</p> <p>Create diagnostic settings in Azure portal</p> <p>You can configure diagnostic settings in the Azure portal either from the Azure Monitor menu or from the menu for the resource.</p> <p></p> <p>Uses for diagnostic logs</p> <p>Here are some of the things you can do with diagnostic logs:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Save them to a storage account for auditing or manual inspection. You can specify the retention time (in days) by using resource diagnostic settings.</li> <li>Stream them to event hubs for ingestion by a third-party service or custom analytics solution, such as Power BI.</li> <li>Analyze them with Azure Monitor, such that the data is immediately written to Azure Monitor with no need to first write the data to storage.</li> </ul> <p>Streaming of diagnostic logs can be enabled programmatically, via the portal, or using the Azure Monitor REST APIs. Either way, you create a diagnostic setting in which you specify an Event Hubs namespace and the log categories and metrics you want to send in to the namespace. An event hub is created in the namespace for each log category you enable. A diagnostic log category is a type of log that a resource may collect.</p> <p>Perform try-this exercises</p> <p>Task 1 - Activity Logs and Alerts</p> <p>In this task, we will configure an alert.</p> <ol> <li>Sign into the Portal.</li> <li>Search for and launch Monitor.</li> <li>Review the capabilities of Monitor: Monitor &amp; Visualize Metrics, Query &amp; Analyze Logs, and Setup Alerts &amp; Actions.</li> <li>Select Activity log.</li> <li>Under the filters, click Timespan and review the drop-down choices.</li> <li>Open an event and discuss.</li> <li>Back in the Monitor main page, click Alerts then click + New alert rule.</li> <li>Under Resource click Select.</li> <li>Discuss how alerts can be scoped by subscription, resource type, and location.</li> <li>Select a resource for the alert and then click Done.</li> <li>Under Condition click Add.</li> <li>Select a signal, such as All Administrative operations, and then click Done.</li> <li>Under Action group, click Create.

You can see which solutions adhere to security measures and which systems need to be secured.</p> <p>Scenario A security engineer uses Microsoft Defender for Cloud to track, maintain and improve an organization's security posture, you'll work on such tasks as:</p> <ul> <li>Implement security recommendations from Microsoft Defender for Cloud.</li> <li>Review your secure score and respond to it.</li> <li>Prevent attacks with Microsoft Defender for Cloud.</li> </ul> <p>MITRE Attack matrix</p> <p>The MITRE ATT&amp;CK matrix is a publicly accessible knowledge base for understanding the various tactics and techniques used by attackers during a cyberattack.</p> <p>The knowledge base is organized into several categories: pre-attack, initial access, execution, persistence, privilege escalation, defense evasion, credential access, discovery, lateral movement, collection, exfiltration, and command and control.</p> <p>Tactics (T) represent the \"why\" of an ATT&amp;CK technique or sub-technique. It is the adversary's tactical goal: the reason for performing an action. For example, an adversary may want to achieve credential access.</p> <p>Techniques (T) represent \"how'\" an adversary achieves a tactical goal by performing an action. For example, an adversary may dump credentials to achieve credential access.</p> <p>Common Knowledge (CK) in ATT&amp;CK stands for common knowledge, essentially the documented modus operandi of tactics and techniques executed by adversaries.</p> <p>Defender for Cloud uses the MITRE Attack matrix to associate alerts with their perceived intent, helping formalize security domain knowledge.</p> <p>Example: Pre-Attack</p> MITRE Attack Tactic Description Pre-Attack Pre-Attack could be either an attempt to access a certain resource regardless of a malicious intent, or a failed attempt to gain access to a target system to gather information prior to exploitation. This step is detected as an attempt, originating from outside the network, to scan the target system and identify an entry point. <p></p> <p>Example: Initial Access</p> MITRE Attack Tactic Description Initial Access Initial Access is the stage where an attacker manages to get a foothold on the attacked resource. This stage is relevant for compute hosts and resources such as user accounts, certificates etc. Threat actors will often be able to control the resource after this stage. <p></p> <p>Implement Microsoft Defender for Cloud</p> <p>Microsoft Defender for Cloud is a solution for cloud security posture management (CSPM) and cloud workload protection (CWP) that finds weak spots across your cloud configuration, helps strengthen the overall security posture of your environment, and can protect workloads across multicloud and hybrid environments from evolving threats.</p> <p>For an interactive overview of how to Manage your cloud security posture with Microsoft Defender for Cloud, click on the image below.</p> <p></p> <p>Defender for Cloud fills three vital needs as you manage the security of your resources and workloads in the cloud and on-premises:</p> <p></p> <ol> <li>Defender for Cloud secure score continually assesses your security posture so you can track new security opportunities and precisely report on the progress of your security efforts.</li> <li>Defender for Cloud recommendations secures your workloads with step-by-step actions that protect your workloads from known security risks.</li> <li>Defender for Cloud alerts defends your workloads in real-time so you can react immediately and prevent security events from developing.</li> </ol> <p>Strengthen the security posture of your cloud resources</p> <ul> <li>Get a continuous assessment of the security of your cloud resources running in Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud.</li> <li>Use built-in policies and prioritized recommendations that are aligned to key industry and regulatory standards or build custom requirements that meet your organization's needs.</li> <li>Gather actionable insights by discovering your complete digital footprint and external attack surface signals and use them to automate recommendations and help ensure that resources are configured securely and meet your compliance needs.</li> </ul> <p>Protect cloud and hybrid workloads against threats</p> <p>Microsoft Defender for Cloud enables you to protect against evolving threats across multicloud and hybrid environments.

For Azure machines, deployment is handled directly. For hybrid and multicloud environments, Microsoft Defender plans are extended to non-Azure machines with the help of Azure Arc. Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) features are extended to multicloud machines without the need for any agents.</p> <p>Defend your Azure-native resources</p> <p>Defender for Cloud helps you detect threats across:</p> <ul> <li>Azure Platform as a Service (PaaS) services - Detect threats targeting Azure services, including Azure App Service, Azure SQL, Azure Storage Account, and more data services. You can also perform anomaly detection on your Azure activity logs using the native integration with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps (formerly known as Microsoft Cloud App Security).</li> <li>Azure data services - Defender for Cloud includes capabilities that help you automatically classify your data in Azure SQL. You can also get assessments for potential vulnerabilities across Azure SQL and Storage services and recommendations for how to mitigate them.</li> <li>Networks - Defender for Cloud helps you limit exposure to brute force attacks. By reducing access to virtual machine ports and using just-in-time VM access, you can harden your network by preventing unnecessary access. You can set secure access policies on selected ports for only authorized users, allowed source IP address ranges or IP addresses, and for a limited amount of time.</li> </ul> <p>Defend your on-premises resources</p> <p>In addition to defending your Azure environment, you can add Defender for Cloud capabilities to your hybrid cloud environment to protect your non-Azure servers. To help you focus on what matters the most, you'll get customized threat intelligence and prioritized alerts according to your specific environment.</p> <p>To extend protection to on-premises machines, deploy Azure Arc and enable Defender for Cloud's enhanced security features.</p> <p>Defend resources running on other clouds</p> <p>Defender for Cloud can protect resources in other clouds (such as Amazon Web Services AWS and Google Cloud Platform GCP).</p> <p>For example, if you've connected an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account to an Azure subscription, you can enable any of these protections:</p> <ul> <li>Defender for Cloud's CSPM features extend to your AWS resources. This agentless plan assesses your AWS resources according to AWS-specific security recommendations, and these are included in your secure score. The resources will also be assessed for compliance with built-in standards specific to AWS (AWS Center for Internet Security (CIS), AWS Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards (DSS), and AWS Foundational Security Best Practices). Defender for Cloud's asset inventory page is a multicloud enabled feature helping you manage your AWS resources alongside your Azure resources.</li> <li>Microsoft Defender for Kubernetes extends its container threat detection and advanced defenses to your Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) Linux clusters.</li> <li>Microsoft Defender for Servers brings threat detection and advanced defenses to your Windows and Linux Elastic Compute Cloud 2 (EC2) instances. This plan includes the integrated license for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, security baselines, and OS level assessments, vulnerability assessment scanning, adaptive application controls (AAC), file integrity monitoring (FIM), and more.</li> </ul> <p>Close vulnerabilities before they get exploited</p> <p></p> <p>Defender for Cloud includes vulnerability assessment solutions for virtual machines, container registries, and SQL servers as part of the enhanced security features. Some of the scanners are powered by Qualys. But you don't need a Qualys license or even a Qualys account - everything's handled seamlessly inside Defender for Cloud.</p> <p>Microsoft Defender for Servers includes automatic, native integration with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. With this integration enabled, you'll have access to the vulnerability findings from Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management.</p> <p>Review the findings from these vulnerability scanners and respond to them all from within Defender for Cloud. This broad approach brings Defender for Cloud closer to being the single pane of glass for all of your cloud security efforts.</p> <p>Enforce your security policy from the top down</p> <p></p> <p>It's a security basic to know and make sure your workloads are secure, and it starts with having tailored security policies in place. Because policies in Defender for Cloud are built on top of Azure Policy controls, you're getting the full range and flexibility of a world-class policy solution. In Defender for Cloud, you can set your policies to run on management groups, across subscriptions, and even for a whole tenant.</p> <p>Defender for Cloud continuously discovers new resources that are being deployed across your workloads and assesses whether they're configured according to security best practices. If not, they're flagged, and you get a prioritized list of recommendations for what you need to fix. Recommendations help you reduce the attack surface across each of your resources.</p> <p>The list of recommendations is enabled and supported by the Microsoft cloud security benchmark. This Microsoft-authored benchmark, based on common compliance frameworks, began with Azure and now provides a set of guidelines for security and compliance best practices for multiple cloud environments.</p> <p>In this way, Defender for Cloud enables you not just to set security policies but to apply secure configuration standards across your resources.</p> <p>Extend Defender for Cloud with Defender plans and external monitoring</p> <p></p> <p>You can extend the Defender for Cloud protection with the following:</p> <ul> <li>Advanced threat protection features for virtual machines, Structured Query Language SQL databases, containers, web applications, your network, and more - Protections include securing the management ports of your VMs with just-in-time access and adaptive application controls to create allowlists for what apps should and shouldn't run on your machines.</li> </ul> <p>The Defender plans of Microsoft Defender for Cloud offer comprehensive defenses for the compute, data, and service layers of your environment:</p> <ul> <li>Microsoft Defender for Servers</li> <li>Microsoft Defender for Storage</li> <li>Microsoft Defender for Structured Query Language (SQL)</li> <li>Microsoft Defender for Containers</li> <li>Microsoft Defender for App Service</li> <li>Microsoft Defender for Key Vault</li> <li>Microsoft Defender for Resource Manager</li> <li>Microsoft Defender for Domain Name System (DNS)</li> <li>Microsoft Defender for open-source relational databases</li> <li>Microsoft Defender for Azure Cosmos Database (DB)</li> <li>Defender Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)<ul> <li>Security governance and regulatory compliance</li> <li>Cloud security explorer</li> <li>Attack path analysis</li> <li>Agentless scanning for machines</li> </ul> </li> <li>Defender for DevOps</li> </ul> <p>Use the advanced protection tiles in the workload protections Azure dashboard to monitor and configure each of these protections.</p> <pre><code>Microsoft Defender for the Internet of Things (IoT) is a separate product.\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>Security alerts - When Defender for Cloud detects a threat in any area of your environment, it generates a security alert. These alerts describe details of the affected resources, suggested remediation steps, and in some cases, an option to trigger a logic app in response. Whether an alert is generated by Defender for Cloud or received by Defender for Cloud from an integrated security product, you can export it. To export your alerts to Microsoft Sentinel, any third-party Security information and event management (SIEM), or any other external tool, follow the instructions in Stream alerts to a SIEM, Security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR), or IT Service Management solution. Defender for Cloud's threat protection includes fusion kill-chain analysis, which automatically correlates alerts in your environment based on cyber kill-chain analysis, to help you better understand the full story of an attack campaign, where it started, and what kind of impact it had on your resources. Defender for Cloud's supported kill chain intents are based on version 9 of the MITRE ATT&amp;CK matrix.</li> </ul> <p>Security posture</p> <p>Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) - Remediate security issues and watch your security posture improve</p> <p>In Defender for Cloud, the posture management features provide the following:</p> <ol> <li>Hardening guidance - to help you efficiently and effectively improve your security</li> <li>Visibility - to help you understand your current security situation</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>Defender for Cloud continually assesses your resources, subscriptions, and organization for security issues and shows your security posture in the secure score, an aggregated score of the security findings that tells you, at a glance, your current security situation: the higher the score, the lower the identified risk level.</p> <p>As soon as you open Defender for Cloud for the first time, Defender for Cloud:</p> <ul> <li>Generates a secure score for your subscriptions based on an assessment of your connected resources compared with the guidance in the Microsoft cloud security benchmark. Use the score to understand your security posture and the compliance dashboard to review your compliance with the built-in benchmark. When you've enabled the enhanced security features, you can customize the standards used to assess your compliance and add other regulations, such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Azure Center for Internet Security (CIS) or organization-specific security requirements. You can also apply recommendations and score based on the AWS Foundational Security Best practices standards.</li> <li>Provides hardening recommendations based on any identified security misconfigurations and weaknesses. Use these security recommendations to strengthen the security posture of your organization's Azure, hybrid, and multicloud resources.</li> <li>Analyzes and secure's your attack paths through the cloud security graph, which is a graph-based context engine that exists within Defender for Cloud. The cloud security graph collects data from your multicloud environment and other data sources. For example, the cloud assets inventory, connections and lateral movement possibilities between resources, exposure to the internet, permissions, network connections, vulnerabilities, and more. The data collected is then used to build a graph representing your multicloud environment.</li> </ul> <p>Attack path analysis is a graph-based algorithm that scans the cloud security graph. The scans expose exploitable paths attackers may use to breach your environment to reach your high-impact assets. Attack path analysis exposes those attack paths and suggests recommendations as to how best to remediate the issues that will break the attack path and prevent a successful breach.</p> <p>By taking your environment's contextual information into account, such as internet exposure, permissions, lateral movement, and more. Attack path analysis identifies issues that may lead to a breach in your environment and helps you to remediate the highest risk ones first.</p> <p>Additional background and details</p> <p>National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)</p> <p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) promotes and maintains measurement standards and guidance to help organizations assess risk. In response to Executive Order 13636 on strengthening the cybersecurity of federal networks and critical infrastructure, NIST released the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (FICIC) in February 2014.</p> <p>The main priorities of the FICIC were to establish a set of standards and practices to help organizations manage cybersecurity risk, while enabling business efficiency. The NIST Framework addresses cybersecurity risk without imposing additional regulatory requirements for both government and private sector organizations.</p> <p>The FICIC references globally recognized standards including NIST Special Publication 800-53 found in Appendix A of the NIST's Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity. Each control within the FICIC framework is mapped to corresponding NIST 800-53 controls within the FedRAMP Moderate Baseline.</p> <p>Center for Internet Security (CIS)</p> <p>The Center for Internet Security is a nonprofit entity whose mission is to identify, develop, validate, promote, and sustain best practice solutions for cyberdefense. It draws on the expertise of cybersecurity and IT professionals from government, business, and academia from around the world. To develop standards and best practices, including CIS benchmarks, controls, and hardened images, they follow a consensus decision-making model.</p> <p>CIS benchmarks are configuration baselines and best practices for securely configuring a system. Each of the guidance recommendations references one or more CIS controls that were developed to help organizations improve their cyberdefense capabilities. CIS controls map to many established standards and regulatory frameworks, including the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and NIST SP 800-53, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27000 series of standards, Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards (DSS), Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), and others.</p> <p>Each benchmark undergoes two phases of consensus review. The first occurs during initial development when experts convene to discuss, create, and test working drafts until they reach consensus on the benchmark. During the second phase, after the benchmark has been published, the consensus team reviews the feedback from the internet community for incorporation into the benchmark.</p> <p>The Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmarks provide two levels of security settings:</p> <ul> <li>Level 1 recommends essential basic security requirements that can be configured on any system and should cause little or no interruption of service or reduced functionality.</li> <li>Level 2 recommends security settings for environments requiring greater security that could result in some reduced functionality.</li> </ul> <p>CIS Hardened Images are securely configured virtual machine images based on CIS Benchmarks hardened to either a Level 1 or Level 2 CIS benchmark profile. Hardening is a process that helps protect against unauthorized access, denial of service, and other cyberthreats by limiting potential weaknesses that make systems vulnerable to cyberattacks.</p> <p>Workload protections</p> <p>Defender for Cloud offers security alerts that are powered by Microsoft Threat Intelligence. It also includes a range of advanced, intelligent protections for your workloads. The workload protections are provided through Microsoft Defender plans specific to the types of resources in your subscriptions. For example, you can enable Microsoft Defender for Storage to get alerted about suspicious activities related to your storage resources.</p> <p>The Cloud workload dashboard includes the following sections:</p> <ol> <li>Microsoft Defender for Cloud coverage - Here you can see the resources types in your subscription that are eligible for protection by Defender for Cloud. Wherever relevant, you can upgrade here as well.

Security governance and regulatory compliance refer to the policies and processes which organizations have in place to ensure that they comply with laws, rules, and regulations put in place by external bodies (government) that control activity in a given jurisdiction. Defender for Cloud allows you to view your regulatory compliance through the regulatory compliance dashboard. Defender for Cloud continuously assesses your hybrid cloud environment to analyze the risk factors according to the controls and best practices in the standards you've applied to your subscriptions. The dashboard reflects the status of your compliance with these standards.       - Cloud security graph          - What is a cloud security graph? The cloud security graph is a graph-based context engine that exists within Defender for Cloud. The cloud security graph collects data from your multicloud environment and other data sources. For example, the cloud assets inventory, connections and lateral movement possibilities between resources, exposure to the internet, permissions, network connections, vulnerabilities, and more. The data collected is then used to build a graph representing your multicloud environment. Defender for Cloud then uses the generated graph to perform an attack path analysis and find the issues with the highest risk that exist within your environment. You can also query the graph using the cloud security explorer.       - Attack path analysis          - What is Attack path analysis? Attack path analysis helps you to address the security issues that pose immediate threats with the greatest potential of being exploited in your environment. Defender for Cloud analyzes which security issues are part of potential attack paths that attackers could use to breach your environment. It also highlights the security recommendations that need to be resolved in order to mitigate the issue.       - Agentless scanning for machines          - What is agentless scanning for machines? Microsoft Defender for Cloud maximizes coverage on OS posture issues and extends beyond the reach of agent-based assessments. With agentless scanning for VMs, you can get frictionless, wide, and instant visibility on actionable posture issues without installed agents, network connectivity requirements, or machine performance impact. Agentless scanning for VMs provides vulnerability assessment and software inventory powered by Defender vulnerability management in Azure and Amazon AWS environments. Agentless scanning is available in Defender Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) and Defender for Servers.</p> <p>Azure Arc</p> <p>Today, companies struggle to control and govern increasingly complex environments that extend across data centers, multiple clouds, and edge. Each environment and cloud possesses its own set of management tools, and new DevOps and IT operations (ITOps) operational models can be hard to implement across resources.</p> <p>Azure Arc simplifies governance and management by delivering a consistent multicloud and on-premises management platform.</p> <p>Azure Arc provides a centralized, unified way to:</p> <ul> <li>Manage your entire environment together by projecting your existing non-Azure and/or on-premises resources into Azure Resource Manager.</li> <li>Manage virtual machines, Kubernetes clusters, and databases as if they are running in Azure.</li> <li>Use familiar Azure services and management capabilities, regardless of where they live.</li> <li>Continue using traditional IT operations (ITOps) while introducing DevOps practices to support new cloud-native patterns in your environment.</li> <li>Configure custom locations as an abstraction layer on top of Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters and cluster extensions.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Azure Arc capabilities</p> <p>Currently, Azure Arc allows you to manage the following resource types hosted outside of Azure:</p> <ul> <li>Servers: Manage Windows and Linux physical servers and virtual machines hosted outside of Azure.</li> <li>Kubernetes clusters: Attach and configure Kubernetes clusters running anywhere with multiple supported distributions.</li> <li>Azure data services: Run Azure data services on-premises, at the edge, and in public clouds using Kubernetes and the infrastructure of your choice. SQL Managed Instance and PostgreSQL server (preview) services are currently available.</li> <li>SQL Server: Extend Azure services to SQL Server instances hosted outside of Azure.</li> <li>Virtual machines (preview): Provision, resize, delete, and manage virtual machines based on VMware vSphere or Azure Stack hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI) and enable VM self-service through role-based access.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Key features and benefits</p> <p>Some of the key scenarios that Azure Arc supports are:</p> <ul> <li>Implement consistent inventory, management, governance, and security for servers across your environment.</li> <li>Configure Azure VM extensions to use Azure management services to monitor, secure, and update your servers.</li> <li>Manage and govern Kubernetes clusters at scale.</li> <li>Use GitOps to deploy configuration across one or more clusters from Git repositories.</li> <li>Zero-touch compliance and configuration for Kubernetes clusters using Azure Policy.</li> <li>Run Azure data services on any Kubernetes environment as if it runs in Azure (specifically Azure SQL Managed Instance and Azure Database for PostgreSQL server, with benefits such as upgrades, updates, security, and monitoring). Use elastic scale and apply updates without any application downtime, even without continuous connection to Azure.</li> <li>Create custom locations on top of your Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters, using them as target locations for deploying Azure services instances. Deploy your Azure service cluster extensions for Azure Arc-enabled data services, App services on Azure Arc (including web, function, and logic apps), and Event Grid on Kubernetes.</li> <li>Perform virtual machine lifecycle and management operations for VMware vSphere and Azure Stack hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI) environments.</li> <li>A unified experience viewing your Azure Arc-enabled resources, whether you are using the Azure portal, the Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, or Azure REST API.</li> </ul> <p>Microsoft cloud security benchmark</p> <p>The Microsoft cloud security benchmark (MCSB) provides prescriptive best practices and recommendations to help improve the security of workloads, data, and services on Azure and your multi-cloud environment, focusing on cloud-centric control areas with input from a set of holistic Microsoft and industry security guidance that includes:</p> <ul> <li>Cloud Adoption Framework: Guidance on security, including strategy, roles and responsibilities, Azure Top 10 Security Best Practices, and reference implementation.</li> <li>Azure Well-Architected Framework: Guidance on securing your workloads on Azure.</li> <li>The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) Workshop: Program guidance and reference strategies to accelerate security modernization using Zero Trust principles.</li> <li>Other industry and cloud service provider's security best practice standards and framework: Examples include the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Well-Architected Framework, Center for Internet Security (CIS) Controls, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS).</li> </ul> <p>Microsoft cloud security benchmark features</p> <p>Comprehensive multi-cloud security framework: Organizations often have to build an internal security standard to reconcile security controls across multiple cloud platforms to meet security and compliance requirements on each of them. This often requires security teams to repeat the same implementation, monitoring, and assessment across the different cloud environments (often for different compliance standards). This creates unnecessary overhead, cost, and effort. To address this concern, we enhanced the Azure Security Benchmark (ASB) to the Microsoft cloud security benchmark (MCSB) to help you quickly work with different clouds by:</p> <ul> <li>Providing a single control framework to easily meet the security controls across clouds</li> <li>Providing consistent user experience for monitoring and enforcing the multi-cloud security benchmark in Defender for Cloud</li> <li>Staying aligned with Industry Standards (e.g., Center for Internet Security, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Payment Card Industry)</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Automated control monitoring for AWS in Microsoft Defender for Cloud: You can use Microsoft Defender for Cloud Regulatory Compliance Dashboard to monitor your AWS environment against Microsoft cloud security benchmark (MCSB), just like how you monitor your Azure environment. We developed approximately 180 AWS checks for the new AWS security guidance in MCSB, allowing you to monitor your AWS environment and resources in Microsoft Defender for Cloud.</p> <p>Example: Microsoft Defender for Cloud - Regulatory compliance dashboard</p> <p></p> <p>Azure guidance and security principles: Azure security guidance, security principles, features, and capabilities.</p> <p>Controls</p> Control Domains Description Network security (NS) Network Security covers controls to secure and protect networks, including securing virtual networks, establishing private connections, preventing and mitigating external attacks, and securing Domain Name System (DNS).

These initiatives contain one or more security policies. Each of those policies results in a security recommendation for improving your security posture.</p> <p>What is a security initiative?</p> <p>A security initiative is a collection of Azure Policy definitions or rules that are grouped together towards a specific goal or purpose. Security initiatives simplify the management of your policies by grouping a set of policies together, logically, as a single item.</p> <p>A security initiative defines the desired configuration of your workloads and helps ensure you comply with the security requirements of your company or regulators.</p> <p>Like security policies, Defender for Cloud initiatives are also created in Azure Policy. You can use Azure Policy to manage your policies, build initiatives, and assign initiatives to multiple subscriptions or entire management groups.</p> <p>The default initiative automatically assigned to every subscription in Microsoft Defender for Cloud is the Microsoft cloud security benchmark. This benchmark is the Microsoft-authored set of guidelines for security and compliance best practices based on common compliance frameworks. This widely respected benchmark builds on the controls from the Center for Internet Security (CIS) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) with a focus on cloud-centric security.</p> <p>Defender for Cloud offers the following options for working with security initiatives and policies:</p> <ul> <li>View and edit the built-in default initiative - When you enable Defender for Cloud, the initiative named 'Microsoft cloud security benchmark' is automatically assigned to all Defender for Cloud registered subscriptions. To customize this initiative, you can enable or disable individual policies within it by editing a policy's parameters.</li> <li>Add your own custom initiatives - If you want to customize the security initiatives applied to your subscription, you can do so within Defender for Cloud. You'll then receive recommendations if your machines don't follow the policies you create.</li> <li>Add regulatory compliance standards as initiatives - Defender for Cloud's regulatory compliance dashboard shows the status of all the assessments within your environment in the context of a particular standard or regulation (such as Azure Center for Internet Security (CIS), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publications (SP) SP 800-53 Rev.4, Swift\u2019s Customer Security Program (CSP) Call Session Control Function (CSCF) v2020).</li> </ul> <p>Example: Builtin security initiative</p> <p></p> <p>What is a security policy?</p> <p>An Azure Policy definition, created in Azure Policy, is a rule about specific security conditions you want to be controlled. Built-in definitions include things like controlling what type of resources can be deployed or enforcing the use of tags on all resources. You can also create your own custom policy definitions.</p> <p>To implement these policy definitions (whether built-in or custom), you'll need to assign them. You can assign any of these policies through the Azure portal, PowerShell, or Azure CLI. Policies can be disabled or enabled from Azure Policy.</p> <p>There are different types of policies in Azure Policy. Defender for Cloud mainly uses 'Audit' policies that check specific conditions and configurations and then report on compliance. There are also \"Enforce' policies that can be used to apply security settings.</p> <p>Example: Built-in security policy</p> <p></p> <p>View and edit security policies</p> <p>Defender for Cloud uses Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC), which provides built-in roles you can assign to Azure users, groups, and services. When users open Defender for Cloud, they see only information related to the resources they can access. Users are assigned the owner, contributor, or reader role to the resource's subscription.</p> <p>There are two specific roles for Defender for Cloud:</p> <ol> <li>Security Administrator: Has the same view rights as security reader. Can also update the security policy and dismiss alerts.</li> <li>Security reader: Has rights to view Defender for Cloud items such as recommendations, alerts, policy, and health. Can't make changes.</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>You can edit security policies through the Azure Policy portal via Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface (REST API) or using Windows PowerShell.</p> <p>The Security Policy screen reflects the action taken by the policies assigned to the subscription or management group you selected.</p> <ul> <li>Use the links at the top to open a policy assignment that applies to the subscription or management group. These links let you access the assignment and edit or disable the policy. For example, if you see that a particular policy assignment is effectively denying endpoint protection, use the link to edit or disable the policy.</li> <li>In the list of policies, you can see the effective application of the policy on your subscription or management group. The settings of each policy that apply to the scope are taken into consideration, and the cumulative outcome of actions taken by the policy is shown. For example, if one assignment of the policy is disabled, but in another, it's set to AuditIfNotExist, then the cumulative effect applies AuditIfNotExist. The more active effect always takes precedence.</li> <li>The policies' effect can be: Append, Audit, AuditIfNotExists, Deny, DeployIfNotExists, or Disabled.</li> </ul> <p>Manage and implement Microsoft Defender for Cloud recommendations</p> <p>What is a security recommendation?</p> <p>Using the policies, Defender for Cloud periodically analyzes the compliance status of your resources to identify potential security misconfigurations and weaknesses. It then provides you with recommendations on how to remediate those issues. Recommendations result from assessing your resources against the relevant policies and identifying resources that aren't meeting your defined requirements.</p> <p>Defender for Cloud makes its security recommendations based on your chosen initiatives. When a policy from your initiative is compared against your resources and finds one or more that isn't compliant, it's presented as a recommendation in Defender for Cloud.</p> <p>Example: Microsoft Defender for Cloud - All recommendations</p> <p></p> <p>Recommendations are actions for you to take to secure and harden your resources. Each recommendation provides you with the following information:</p> <ul> <li>A short description of the issue</li> <li>The remediation steps to carry out in order to implement the recommendation</li> <li>The affected resources</li> </ul> <p>In practice, it works like this:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Microsoft Cloud security benchmark is an initiative that contains requirements.       For example, Azure Storage accounts must restrict network access to reduce their attack surface.</p> </li> <li> <p>The initiative includes multiple policies, each requiring a specific resource type. These policies enforce the requirements in the initiative.       To continue the example, the storage requirement is enforced with the policy \"Storage accounts should restrict network access using virtual network rules.\"</p> </li> <li>Microsoft Defender for Cloud continually assesses your connected subscriptions. If it finds a resource that doesn't satisfy a policy, it displays a recommendation to fix that situation and harden the security of resources that aren't meeting your security requirements.       For example, if an Azure Storage account on your protected subscriptions isn't protected with virtual network rules, you see the recommendation to harden those resources.</li> </ol> <p>So, (1) an initiative includes (2) policies that generate (3) environment-specific recommendations.</p> <p>Security recommendation details</p> <p>Security recommendations contain details that help you understand its significance and how to handle it.</p> <p></p> <p>The recommendation details shown are:</p> <ol> <li>For supported recommendations, the top toolbar shows any or all of the following buttons:<ul> <li>Enforce and Deny</li> <li>View the policy definition to go directly to the Azure Policy entry for the underlying policy.</li> <li>Open query - You can view the detailed information about the affected resources using Azure Resource Graph Explorer.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Severity indicator</li> <li>Freshness interval</li> <li>Count of exempted resources if exemptions exist for a recommendation; this shows the number of resources that have been exempted with a link to view the specific resources.</li> <li> <p>Mapping to MITRE ATT&amp;CK tactics and techniques if a recommendation has defined tactics and techniques, select the icon for links to the relevant pages on MITRE's site. This applies only to Azure-scored recommendations.</p> <p>    6. Description - A short description of the security issue.    7. When relevant, the details page also includes a table of related recommendations:  The relationship types are:     - Prerequisite - A recommendation that must be completed before the selected recommendation     - Alternative - A different recommendation that provides another way of achieving the goals of the selected recommendation     - Dependent - A recommendation for which the selected recommendation is a prerequisite   For each related recommendation, the number of unhealthy resources is shown in the \"Affected resources\" column.    8. Remediation steps - A description of the manual steps required to remediate the security issue on the affected resources. For recommendations with the Fix option, you can select View remediation logic before applying the suggested fix to your resources.    9. Affected resources - Your resources are grouped into tabs:   - Healthy resources \u2013 Relevant resources that either aren't impacted or on which you have already remediated the issue.   - Unhealthy resources \u2013 Resources that are still impacted by the identified issue.   - Not applicable resources \u2013 Resources for which the recommendation can't give a definitive answer. The not applicable tab also includes reasons for each resource.   10. Action buttons to remediate the recommendation or trigger a logic app.   </p> </li> </ol> <p>Viewing the relationship between a recommendation and a policy</p> <p>As mentioned above, Defender for Cloud's built-in recommendations are based on the Microsoft cloud security benchmark. Almost every recommendation has an underlying policy that is derived from a requirement in the benchmark.</p> <p>When you're reviewing the details of a recommendation, it's often helpful to be able to see the underlying policy. For every recommendation supported by a policy, use the View policy definition link from the recommendation details page to go directly to the Azure Policy entry for the relevant policy:</p> <p></p> <p>Use this link to view the policy definition and review the evaluation logic.</p> <p>If you're reviewing the list of recommendations on our Security recommendations reference guide, you'll also see links to the policy definition pages:</p> <p></p> <p>Explore secure score</p> <p>Overview of secure score</p> <p>Microsoft Defender for Cloud has two main goals:</p> <ol> <li>to help you understand your current security situation</li> <li>to help you efficiently and effectively improve your security</li> </ol> <p>The central feature in Defender for Cloud that enables you to achieve those goals is the secure score.</p> <p>Defender for Cloud continually assesses your cross-cloud resources for security issues. It then aggregates all the findings into a single score so that you can tell, at a glance, your current security situation: the higher the score, the lower the identified risk level.</p> <ul> <li>In the Azure portal pages, the secure score is shown as a percentage value, and the underlying values are also clearly presented:</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>In the Azure mobile app, the secure score is shown as a percentage value, and you can tap the secure score to see the details that explain the score:</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>To increase your security, review Defender for Cloud's recommendations page and remediate the recommendation by implementing the remediation instructions for each issue. Recommendations are grouped into security controls. Each control is a logical group of related security recommendations and reflects your vulnerable attack surfaces. Your score only improves when you remediate all of the recommendations for a single resource within a control. To see how well your organization is securing each individual attack surface, review the scores for each security control.</p> <p>How your secure score is calculated</p> <p></p> <p>To get all the possible points for security control, all of your resources must comply with all of the security recommendations within the security control. For example, Defender for Cloud has multiple recommendations regarding how to secure your management ports. You'll need to remediate them all to make a difference to your secure score.</p> <p>Example scores for a control</p> <p></p> <p>In this example:</p> <ul> <li>Remediate vulnerabilities security control - This control group has multiple recommendations related to discovering and resolving known vulnerabilities.</li> <li>Max score - The maximum number of points you can gain by completing all recommendations within a control. The maximum score for a control indicates the relative significance of that control and is fixed for every environment. Use the max score values to triage the issues to work on first.</li> <li>Current score - The current score for this control.      Current score = [Score per resource] * [Number of healthy resources]      Each control contributes towards the total score. In this example, the control is contributing 2.00 points to the current total secure score.</li> <li>Potential score increase - The remaining points available to you are within your control. If you remediate all the recommendations in this control, your score will increase by 9%.      Potential score increase = [Score per resource] * [Number of unhealthy resources]</li> <li>Insights - Gives you extra details for each recommendation, such as:<ul> <li>Preview recommendation - This recommendation won't affect your secure score until it's GA.</li> <li>Fix - From within the recommendation details page, you can use 'Fix' to resolve this issue.</li> <li>Enforce - From within the recommendation details page, you can automatically deploy a policy to fix this issue whenever someone creates a non-compliant resource.</li> <li>Deny - From within the recommendation details page, you can prevent new resources from being created with this issue.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Which recommendations are included in the secure score calculations?</p> <ul> <li>Only built-in recommendations have an impact on the secure score.</li> <li>Recommendations flagged as Preview aren't included in the calculations of your secure score. They should still be remediated wherever possible so that when the preview period ends, they'll contribute towards your score.</li> <li>Preview recommendations are marked with:</li> </ul> <p>Improve your secure score</p> <p>To improve your secure score, remediate security recommendations from your recommendations list. You can remediate each recommendation manually for each resource or use the Fix option (when available) to resolve an issue on multiple resources quickly.</p> <p>You can also configure the Enforce and Deny options on the relevant recommendations to improve your score and make sure your users don't create resources that negatively impact your score.</p> <p>Frequently asked questions (FAQ) Secure score</p> <p>If I address only three out of four recommendations in security control, will my secure score change?</p> <p>No. It won't change until you remediate all of the recommendations for a single resource. To get the maximum score for a control, you must remediate all recommendations for all resources.</p> <p>If a recommendation isn't applicable to me, and I disable it in the policy, will my security control be fulfilled and my secure score updated?</p> <p>Yes. We recommend disabling recommendations when they're inapplicable in your environment.</p> <p>If a security control offers me zero points toward my secure score, should I ignore it?</p> <p>In some cases, you'll see a control max score greater than zero, but the impact is zero. When the incremental score for fixing resources is negligible, it's rounded to zero. Don't ignore these recommendations because they still bring security improvements. The only exception is the \"Additional Best Practice\" control. Remediating these recommendations won't increase your score, but it will enhance your overall security.</p> <p>Define brute force attacks</p> <p>Brute force attacks</p> <p>A brute force attack is a type of hacking technique in which an attacker tries to gain access to a network or system by guessing the username and password combination through an automated process. The attacker typically uses a program that generates a large number of login attempts in a short period of time to try every possible combination of characters until the correct one is discovered. This type of attack can be very effective against weak passwords and security systems with no protection against brute force attacks, but it is time-consuming and can be detected by security measures such as account lockouts after a certain number of failed login attempts.</p> <p>Management services, ports, and protocols</p> <p>Adversaries without prior knowledge of legitimate credentials within the system or environment may guess passwords to attempt access to accounts. Without knowledge of the password for an account, an adversary may opt to systematically guess the password using a repetitive or iterative mechanism. An adversary may guess login credentials without prior knowledge of system or environment passwords during an operation by using a list of common passwords. Password guessing may or may not take into account the target's policies on password complexity or use policies that may lock accounts out after a number of failed attempts.</p> <p>Typically, management services over commonly used ports are used when guessing passwords. Commonly targeted services include the following:</p> <p></p> <p>Brute force attack programs and use cases</p> <p>These programs can be used individually or in combination to launch a successful brute force attack on a target network or system. There are several types of brute force attack programs used by attackers, including:</p> <p></p> <p>Indications of an attack</p> <ul> <li>Extreme counts of failed sign-ins from many unknown usernames</li> <li>Never previously successfully authenticated from multiple remote desktop protocol (RDP) connections or from new source IP addresses</li> </ul> <p>Example: Potential SQL Brute Force attempt alert</p> <p></p> <p>Practices to blunt a Brute Force Attacks</p> <p>To counteract brute-force attacks, you can take multiple measures such as:</p> <ul> <li>Disable the public IP address and use one of these connection methods:<ul> <li>Use a point-to-site virtual private network (VPN)</li> <li>Create a site-to-site VPN</li> <li>Use Azure ExpressRoute to create secure links from your on-premises network to Azure.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Require two-factor authentication</li> <li>Increase password length and complexity</li> <li>Limit login attempts</li> <li>Implement Captcha<ul> <li>About CAPTCHAs - Any time you let people register on your site or even enter a name and URL (like for a blog comment), you might get a flood of fake names. These are often left by automated programs (bots) that try to leave URLs on every website they can find. (A common motivation is to post the URLs of products for sale.) You can help make sure that a user is a real person and not a computer program by using a CAPTCHA to validate users when they register or otherwise enter their name and site.</li> <li>CAPTCHA stands for Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart. A CAPTCHA is a challenge-response test in which the user is asked to do something that is easy for a person to do but hard for an automated program to do. The most common type of CAPTCHA is one where you see distorted letters and are asked to type them. (The distortion is supposed to make it hard for bots to decipher the letters.)</li> </ul> </li> <li>Limit the amount of time that the ports are open.</li> </ul> <p>Understand just-in-time VM access</p> <p>The risk of open management ports on a virtual machine</p> <p>Threat actors actively hunt accessible machines with open management ports, like remote desktop protocol (RDP) or secure shell protocol (SSH). All of your virtual machines are potential targets for an attack. When a VM is successfully compromised, it's used as the entry point to attack further resources within your environment.</p> <p>Why JIT VM access is the solution</p> <p>As with all cybersecurity prevention techniques, your goal should be to reduce the attack surface. In this case, that means having fewer open ports, especially management ports. Your legitimate users also use these ports, so it's not practical to keep them closed. To solve this dilemma, Microsoft Defender for Cloud offers JIT. With JIT, you can lock down the inbound traffic to your VMs, reducing exposure to attacks while providing easy access to connect to VMs when needed.</p> <p>How JIT operates with network resources in Azure and AWS</p> <p>In Azure, you can block inbound traffic on specific ports, by enabling just-in-time VM access. Defender for Cloud ensures \"deny all inbound traffic\" rules exist for your selected ports in the network security group (NSG) and Azure Firewall rules. These rules restrict access to your Azure VMs\u2019 management ports and defend them from attack.</p> <p>If other rules already exist for the selected ports, then those existing rules take priority over the new \"deny all inbound traffic\" rules. If there are no existing rules on the selected ports, then the new rules take top priority in the NSG and Azure Firewall.</p> <p>In AWS, by enabling JIT-access the relevant rules in the attached Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) security groups, for the selected ports, are revoked which blocks inbound traffic on those specific ports.</p> <p>When a user requests access to a VM, Defender for Cloud checks that the user has Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) permissions for that VM. If the request is approved, Defender for Cloud configures the NSGs and Azure Firewall to allow inbound traffic to the selected ports from the relevant IP address (or range), for the amount of time that was specified. In AWS, Defender for Cloud creates a new EC2 security group that allows inbound traffic to the specified ports. After the time has expired, Defender for Cloud restores the NSGs to their previous states. Connections that are already established are not interrupted.</p> <p>Just-in-time VM enabled on an Azure Virtual Machine.</p> <p>Example: Azure virtual machine</p> <p>The diagram shows the logic that Defender for Cloud applies when deciding how to categorize your supported VMs (i.e., Azure Virtual Machine)</p> <p></p> <p>Just-in-time VM enabled on an AWS EC2 Instance.</p> <p>The diagram shows the logic that Defender for Cloud applies when deciding how to categorize your supported VMs (i.e., AWS EC2 instance)</p> <p>Example: AWS EC2 Instance</p> <p></p> <p>Added to the recommendation\u2019s Unhealthy resources tab</p> <p>The diagram shows the logic Defender for Cloud applies when deciding how to categorize your supported VM. When Defender for Cloud finds a machine that can benefit from JIT, it adds that machine to the recommendation's Unhealthy resources tab.</p> <p>Example: Affected resources</p> <p></p> <p>Implement just-in-time VM access</p> <p>Just-in-time (JIT) virtual machine (VM) access is used to lock down inbound traffic to your Azure VMs, reducing exposure to attacks while providing easy access to connect to VMs when needed.</p> <p>When you enable JIT VM Access for your VMs, you next create a policy that determines the ports to help protect, how long ports should remain open, and the approved IP addresses that can access these ports. The policy helps you stay in control of what users can do when they request access. Requests are logged in the Azure activity log, so you can easily monitor and audit access. The policy will also help you quickly identify the existing VMs that have JIT VM Access enabled and the VMs where JIT VM Access is recommended.</p> <p>How JIT VM Access works</p> <p>To use Just-in-Time VM access, you must enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud.</p> <p></p> <p>After you enable Defender, you can view which virtual machines have JIT configured. Enable JIT on any virtual machine that is not Healthy.</p> <p></p> <p>For each virtual machine, you are recommended specific ports and access.</p> <p></p> <p>You can accept the recommendations or Add other ports of your choosing.</p> <p></p> <p>Once everything is in place, users must request access to the virtual machine. You can also monitor the usage of each virtual machine.</p> <p></p> <p>Perform try-this exercises</p> <p>Task 1: Microsoft Defender for Cloud overview and recommendations</p> <p>In this task, you will review Microsoft Defender for Cloud.</p> <ol> <li>In the Portal, navigate to Microsoft Defender for Cloud.</li> <li>Under General, select Overview.</li> <li>Discuss the Overview page.</li> <li>Under Management, select Environment settings.</li> <li>Select your subscription, and then review the Microsoft Defender for Cloud features.</li> <li>Return to the main Microsoft Defender for Cloud blade.</li> <li>Under General, select Recommendations.</li> <li>Review Secure Score, Recommendations status, and Resource Health.</li> <li>From the main Microsoft Defender for Cloud blade, under Cloud Security, select Regulatory compliance.</li> <li>Review the compliance assessment and available compliance controls.</li> <li>Scroll down and, under Microsoft cloud security benchmark, expand each compliance control to review several recommendations.

What do you do at this point to find and evaluate a breach? Microsoft Sentinel is a tool to help you locate a breach and track what the intruder did while on your systems.</p> <p>Scenario</p> <p>A security engineer uses Microsoft Sentinel to discover and track a breach, you will work on such tasks as:</p> <ul> <li>Configure Microsoft Sentinel.</li> <li>Build queries to find breaches.</li> <li>Track incidents with investigation and hunting.</li> </ul> <p>Enable Azure Sentinel</p> <p>Microsoft Sentinel is a scalable, cloud-native, security information event management (SIEM) and security orchestration automated response (SOAR) solution. Microsoft Sentinel delivers intelligent security analytics and threat intelligence across the enterprise, providing a single solution for alert detection, threat visibility, proactive hunting, and threat response.</p> <p>Value of a security information and event management tool</p> <p>Security Operations (SecOps) teams are inundated with a high volume of alerts and spend far too much time in tasks like infrastructure setup and maintenance. As a result, many legitimate threats go unnoticed. According to the \u201cCybersecurity Jobs Report, 2018-2021\u201d by Cybersecurity Ventures, An expected shortfall of 3.5M security professionals by 2021 will further increase the challenges for security operations teams. Alert fatigue is real. Security analysts face a huge burden of triage as they not only have to sift through a sea of alerts but also correlate alerts from different products manually or using a traditional correlation engine.</p> <p>Microsoft Azure Sentinel</p> <p>Microsoft Sentinel offers nearly limitless cloud scale and speed to address your security needs. Think of Microsoft Sentinel as the first SIEM-as-a-service that brings the power of the cloud and artificial intelligence to help security operations teams efficiently identify and stop cyber-attacks before they cause harm. Microsoft Sentinel enriches your investigation and detection by providing both Microsoft's threat intelligence stream and external threat intelligence streams.</p> <p>Microsoft Sentinel integrates with Microsoft 365 solution and correlates millions of signals from different products such as Azure Identity Protection, Microsoft Cloud App Security, and soon Azure Advanced Threat Protection, Windows Advanced Threat Protection, M365 Advanced Threat Protection, Intune, and Azure Information Protection. It enables the following services:    - Collect data at cloud scale across all users, devices, applications, and infrastructure, both on-premises and in multiple clouds.    - Detect previously undetected threats, and minimize false positives using Microsoft's analytics and unparalleled threat intelligence.    - Investigate threats with artificial intelligence, and hunt for suspicious activities at scale, tapping into years of cyber security work at Microsoft.    - Respond to incidents rapidly with built-in orchestration and automation of common tasks</p> <p></p> <p>Building on the full range of existing Azure services, Microsoft Sentinel natively incorporates proven foundations, like Log Analytics, and Logic Apps. Microsoft Sentinel enriches your investigation and detection with AI, and provides Microsoft's threat intelligence stream, and enables you to bring your own threat intelligence.</p> <p>Configure data connections to Sentinel</p> <p>To onboard Microsoft Sentinel, you first need to connect to your security sources. Microsoft Sentinel comes with a number of connectors for Microsoft solutions, available out of the box and providing real-time integration, including Microsoft Threat Protection solutions, and Microsoft 365 sources, including Microsoft 365, Azure AD, Azure ATP, and Microsoft Cloud App Security, and more. In addition, there are built-in connectors to the broader security ecosystem for non-Microsoft solutions. You can also use common event format, Syslog or REST-API to connect your data sources with Microsoft Sentinel as well.</p> <p></p> <p>Data connection methods</p> <p>The following data connection methods are supported by Microsoft Sentinel:</p> <ul> <li>Service to service integration: Some services are connected natively, such as AWS and Microsoft services, these services leverage the Azure foundation for out-of-the-box integration, the following solutions can be connected in a few clicks:</li> <li>Amazon Web Services - CloudTrail</li> <li>Azure Activity</li> <li>Azure AD audit logs and sign-ins</li> <li>Azure AD Identity Protection</li> <li>Azure Advanced Threat Protection</li> <li>Azure Information Protection</li> <li>Microsoft Defender for Cloud</li> <li>Cloud App SecurityCloud App Security</li> <li>Domain name server</li> <li>Microsoft 365</li> <li>Microsoft Defender ATP</li> <li>Microsoft web application firewall</li> <li>Windows firewall</li> <li>Windows security events</li> </ul> <p>External solutions via API</p> <p>Some data sources are connected using APIs that are provided by the connected data source. Typically, most security technologies provide a set of APIs through which event logs can be retrieved. The APIs connect to Microsoft Sentinel and gather specific data types and send them to Azure Log Analytics</p> <p>External solutions via an agen</p> <p>Microsoft Sentinel can be connected to all other data sources that can perform real-time log streaming using the Syslog protocol, via an agent. The Microsoft Sentinel agent, which is based on the Log Analytics agent, converts CEF formatted logs into a format that can be ingested by Log Analytics. Depending on the appliance type, the agent is installed either directly on the appliance, or on a dedicated Linux server.</p> <p>Agent connection options</p> <p>To connect your external appliance to Microsoft Sentinel, the agent must be deployed on a dedicated machine (VM or on-premises) to support the communication between the appliance and Microsoft Sentinel. You can deploy the agent automatically or manually. Automatic deployment is only available if your dedicated machine is a new VM you are creating in Azure.</p> <p></p> <p>Alternatively, you can deploy the agent manually on an existing Azure VM, on a VM in another cloud, or on an on-premises machine.</p> <p>Global prerequisites</p> <ul> <li>Active Azure Subscription</li> <li>Log Analytics workspace.</li> <li>To enable Microsoft Sentinel, you need contributor permissions to the subscription in which the Microsoft Sentinel workspace resides.</li> <li>To use Microsoft Sentinel, you need either contributor or reader permissions on the resource group that the workspace belongs to.</li> <li>Additional permissions may be needed to connect specific data sources.</li> <li>Microsoft Sentinel is a paid service.</li> </ul> <p>Create workbooks for explore Sentinel data</p> <p>After you connect your data sources to Microsoft Sentinel, you can monitor the data using the Microsoft Sentinel integration with Azure Monitor Workbooks, which provides versatility in creating custom workbooks. While Workbooks are displayed differently in Microsoft Sentinel, it may be helpful for you to determine how to create interactive reports with Azure Monitor Workbooks. Microsoft Sentinel allows you to create custom workbooks across your data and comes with built-in workbook templates to quickly gain insights across your data as soon as you connect a data source.</p> <p></p> <p>Workbooks combine text, Analytics queries, Azure Metrics, and parameters into rich interactive reports. Workbooks are editable by other team members who have access to the same Azure resources.</p> <p>Workbooks are helpful for scenarios like:</p> <ul> <li>Exploring the usage of your app when you don't know the metrics of interest in advance: numbers of users, retention rates, conversion rates, etc. Unlike other usage analytics tools, workbooks let you combine multiple kinds of visualizations and analyses, making them great for this kind of free-form exploration.</li> <li>Explaining to your team how a newly released feature is performing by showing user counts for key interactions and other metrics.</li> <li>Sharing the results of an A/B experiment in your app with other members of your team. You can explain the goals for the experiment with text, then show each usage metric and Analytics query used to evaluate the experiment, along with clear call-outs for whether each metric was above- or below-target.</li> <li>Reporting the impact of an outage on the usage of your app, combining data, text explanation, and a discussion of next steps to prevent outages in the future.</li> </ul> <p>Saving and sharing workbooks with your team</p> <p>Workbooks are saved within an Application Insights resource, either in the My Reports section that's private to you or in the Shared Reports section accessible to everyone with access to the Application Insights resource. A workbook can be shared with a link or via email. Keep in mind that recipients of the link need access to this resource in the Azure portal to view the workbook. To make edits, recipients need at least Contributor permissions for the resource.</p> <p>Analytics</p> <p>To help you reduce noise and minimize the number of alerts you have to review and investigate, Microsoft Sentinel uses analytics to correlate alerts into incidents. Incidents are groups of related alerts that together create a possible actionable threat that you can investigate and resolve. Use the built-in correlation rules as-is, or use them as a starting point to build your own. Microsoft Sentinel also provides machine learning rules to map your network behavior and then look for anomalies across your resources. These analytics connect the dots by combining low-fidelity alerts about different entities into potential high-fidelity security incidents.</p> <p>Enable rules to create incidents</p> <p>Alerts triggered in Microsoft security solutions that are connected to Microsoft Sentinel, such as Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps and Azure Advanced Threat Protection, do not automatically create incidents in Microsoft Sentinel. By default, when you connect a Microsoft solution to Microsoft Sentinel, any alert generated in that service will be stored as raw data in Microsoft Sentinel, in the Security Alert table in your Microsoft Sentinel workspace. You can then use that data like any other raw data you connect to Sentinel.</p> <p>Prerequisites</p> <p>You must connect Microsoft security solutions to enable incident creation from security service alerts.</p> <p>Using Microsoft Security incident creation analytic rules</p> <p>Use the built-in rules available in Microsoft Sentinel to choose which connected Microsoft security solutions should create Microsoft Sentinel incidents automatically in real-time. You can also edit the rules to define more specific options for filtering which of the alerts generated by the Microsoft security solution should create incidents in Microsoft Sentinel. For example, you can choose to create Microsoft Sentinel incidents automatically only from high-severity Microsoft Defender for Cloud alerts.</p> <p></p> <p>You can create more than one Microsoft Security analytic rule per Microsoft security service type. This action does not create duplicate incidents since each rule is used as a filter. Even if an alert matches more than one Microsoft Security analytic rule, it creates just one Microsoft Sentinel incident.</p> <p>When you connect a Microsoft security solution, you can select whether you want the alerts from the security solution to automatically generate incidents in Microsoft Sentinel automatically.</p> <p>Configure playbooks</p> <p>Security automation and orchestration lets you automate your common tasks and simplify security orchestration with playbooks that integrate with Azure services as well as your existing tools. Built on the foundation of Azure Logic Apps, Azure Sentinel's automation and orchestration solution provides a highly-extensible architecture that enables scalable automation as new technologies and threats emerge. To build playbooks with Azure Logic Apps, you can choose from a growing gallery of built-in playbooks. These include 200+ connectors for services such as Azure functions. The connectors allow you to apply any custom logic in code, ServiceNow, Jira, Zendesk, HTTP requests, Microsoft Teams, Slack, Windows Defender ATP, and Cloud App Security.</p> <p>For example, if you use the ServiceNow ticketing system, you can use the tools provided to use Azure Logic Apps to automate your workflows and open a ticket in ServiceNow each time a particular event is detected.</p> <p></p> <p>Hunt and investigate potential breaches</p> <p>Currently in preview, Microsoft Sentinel deep investigation tools help you to understand the scope and find the root cause, of a potential security threat. You can choose an entity on the interactive graph to ask interesting questions for a specific entity, and drill down into that entity and its connections to get to the root cause of the threat.</p> <p>An incident can include multiple alerts. It's an aggregation of all the relevant evidence for a specific investigation. An incident is created based on analytic rules that you created in the Analytics page. The properties related to the alerts, such as severity, and status, are set at the incident level. After you let Microsoft Sentinel know what kinds of threats you're looking for and how to find them, you can monitor detected threats by investigating incidents.</p> <p>Use the investigation graph to deep dive</p> <p>The investigation graph enables analysts to ask the right questions for each investigation. The investigation graph helps you understand the scope, and identify the root cause, of a potential security threat by correlating relevant data with any involved entity. You can dive deeper and investigate any entity presented in the graph by selecting it and choosing between different expansion options.</p> <p>The investigation graph provides you with:    - Visual context from raw data: The live, visual graph displays entity relationships extracted automatically from the raw data. This enables you to easily view connections across different data sources.    - Full investigation scope discovery: Expand your investigation scope using built-in exploration queries to surface the full scope of a breach.    - Built-in investigation steps: Use predefined exploration options to make sure you are asking the right questions in the face of a threat.</p> <p>To use the investigation graph:</p> <p>Select an incident, then select Investigate. This takes you to the investigation graph. The graph provides an illustrative map of the entities directly connected to the alert and each resource connected further.</p> <p></p> <p>You'll only be able to investigate the incident if you used the entity mapping fields when you set up your analytic rule. The investigation graph requires that your original incident includes entities.</p> <p>Hunting</p> <p>Use Microsoft's Sentinel's powerful hunting search-and-query tools, based on the MITRE framework, which enable you to proactively hunt for security threats across your organization\u2019s data sources, before an alert is triggered. After you discover which hunting query provides high-value insights into possible attacks, you can also create custom detection rules based on your query, and surface those insights as alerts to your security incident responders. While hunting, you can create bookmarks for interesting events, enabling you to return to them later, share them with others, and group them with other correlating events to create a compelling incident for investigation.</p> <p>For example, one built-in query provides data about the most uncommon processes running on your infrastructure. You may not want an alert each time they are run.</p> <p>With Microsoft Sentinel hunting, you can take advantage of the following capabilities:</p> <ul> <li>Built-in queries: To get you started, a starting page provides preloaded query examples designed to get you started and get you familiar with the tables and the query language. These built-in hunting queries are developed by Microsoft security researchers on a continuous basis, adding new queries, and fine-tuning existing queries to provide you with an entry point to look for new detections and figure out where to start hunting for the beginnings of new attacks.</li> <li>Powerful query language with IntelliSense: Built on top of a query language that gives you the flexibility you need to take hunting to the next level.</li> <li>Create your own bookmarks: During the hunting process, you may come across matches or findings, dashboards, or activities that look unusual or suspicious. In order to mark those items so you can come back to them in the future, use the bookmark functionality. Bookmarks let you save items for later, to be used to create an incident for investigation.</li> <li>Use notebooks to automate investigation: Notebooks are like step-by-step playbooks that you can build to walk through the steps of an investigation and hunt. Notebooks encapsulate all the hunting steps in a reusable playbook that can be shared with others in your organization.</li> <li>Query the stored data: The data is accessible in tables for you to query. For example, you can query process creation, DNS events, and many other event types.</li> <li>Links to the community: Leverage the power of the greater community to find additional queries and data sources.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Community</p> <p>The Microsoft Sentinel community is a powerful resource for threat detection and automation. Our Microsoft security analysts constantly create and add new workbooks, playbooks, hunting queries, and more, posting them to the community for you to use in your environment. You can download sample content from the private community GitHub repository to create custom workbooks, hunting queries, notebooks, and playbooks for Microsoft Sentinel.</p> <p>Knowledge check</p> <ol> <li> <p>Where can custom security alerts be created and managed?</p> </li> <li> <p>Azure Security Center</p> </li> <li>Azure Sentinel (Ans)</li> <li> <p>Azure Storage</p> </li> <li> <p>Which of the items below would exceed the capabilities of an Azure Sentinel playbook?</p> </li> <li> <p>A Sentinel playbook can help automate and orchestrate an incident response.</p> </li> <li>A Sentinel playbook be run manually or set to run automatically when specific alerts are triggered.</li> <li> <p>A Sentinel playbook be created to handle several subscriptions at once.

Key Vault streamlines the key management process and enables you to maintain control of keys that access and encrypt your data. Developers can create keys for development and testing in minutes, and then migrate them to production keys. Security administrators can grant (and revoke) permission to keys, as needed.</p> <p>You can use Key Vault to create multiple secure containers, called vaults. Vaults help reduce the chances of accidental loss of security information by centralizing application secrets storage. Key vaults also control and log the access to anything stored in them.</p> <p>Azure Key Vault can manage requesting and renewing TLS certificates. It provides features for a robust solution for certificate lifecycle management.</p> <p>Azure Key Vault helps address the following issues:</p> <ul> <li>Secrets management. You can use Azure Key Vault to securely store and tightly control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, API keys, and other secrets.</li> <li>Key management. You use Azure Key Vault as a key management solution, making it easier to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data.</li> <li>Certificate management. Azure Key Vault is also a service that lets you easily provision, manage, and deploy public and private SSL/TLS certificates for use with Azure and your internal connected resources.</li> <li>Store secrets backed by hardware security modules (HSMs). The secrets and keys can be protected either by software, or FIPS 140-2 Level 2 validates HSMs.</li> </ul> <p>Azure Key Vault is designed to support application keys and secrets. Key Vault is not intended as storage for user passwords.</p> <p>The following table lists security best practices for using Key Vault.</p> Best practice Solution Grant access to users, groups, and applications at a specific scope. Use RBAC\u2019s predefined roles. For example, to grant access to a user to manage key vaults, you would assign the predefined role Key Vault Contributor to this user at a specific scope. The scope in this case would be a subscription, a resource group, or just a specific key vault. If the predefined roles don\u2019t fit your needs, you can define your own roles. Control what users have access to. Access to a key vault is controlled through two separate interfaces: management plane, and data plane. The management plane and data plane access controls work independently. Use RBAC to control what users have access to. For example, if you want to grant an application access to use keys in a key vault, you only need to grant data plane access permissions by using key vault access policies, and no management plane access is needed for this application. Conversely, if you want a user to be able to read vault properties and tags but not have any access to keys, secrets, or certificates, you can grant this user read access by using RBAC, and no access to the data plane is required. Store certificates in your key vault. Azure Resource Manager can securely deploy certificates stored in Azure Key Vault to Azure VMs when the VMs are deployed. By setting appropriate access policies for the key vault, you also control who gets access to your certificate. Another benefit is that you manage all your certificates in one place in Azure Key Vault. Ensure that you can recover a deletion of key vaults or key vault objects. Deletion of key vaults or key vault objects can be either inadvertent or malicious. Enable the soft delete and purge protection features of Key Vault, particularly for keys that are used to encrypt data at rest. Deletion of these keys is equivalent to data loss, so you can recover deleted vaults and vault objects if needed. Practice Key Vault recovery operations on a regular basis. <p>Azure Key Vault is offered in two service tiers\u2014standard and premium</p> <p>The main difference between Standard and Premium is that Premium supports HSM-protected keys.</p> <pre><code>Important\n\nIf a user has contributor permissions (RBAC) to a key vault management plane, they can grant themselves access to the data plane by setting a key vault access policy. We recommend that you tightly control who has contributor access to your key vaults, to ensure that only authorized persons can access and manage your key vaults, keys, secrets, and certificates.\n</code></pre> <p>Configure Key Vault access</p> <p>Access to a key vault is controlled through two interfaces: the management plane, and the data plane. The management plane is where you manage Key Vault itself. Operations in this plane include creating and deleting key vaults, retrieving Key Vault properties, and updating access policies. The data plane is where you work with the data stored in a key vault. You can add, delete, and modify keys, secrets, and certificates from here.</p> <p></p> <p>To access a key vault in either plane, all callers (users or applications) must have proper authentication and authorization. Authentication establishes the identity of the caller. Authorization determines which operations the caller can execute.</p> <p>Both planes use Azure AD for authentication. For authorization, the management plane uses RBAC, and the data plane can use either newly added RBAC or a Key Vault access policy.</p> <p>Active Directory authentication</p> <p>When you create a key vault in an Azure subscription, its automatically associated with the Azure AD tenant of the subscription. All callers in both planes must register in this tenant and authenticate to access the key vault. In both cases, applications can access Key Vault in two ways:</p> <ul> <li>User plus application access. The application accesses Key Vault on behalf of a signed-in user. Examples of this type of access include Azure PowerShell and the Azure portal. User access is granted in two ways. They can either access Key Vault from any application, or they must use a specific application (referred to as compound identity).</li> <li>Application-only access. The application runs as a daemon service or background job. The application identity is granted access to the key vault.</li> </ul> <p>For both types of access, the application authenticates with Azure AD. The application uses any supported authentication method based on the application type. The application acquires a token for a resource in the plane to grant access. The resource is an endpoint in the management or data plane, based on the Azure environment. The application uses the token and sends a REST API request to Key Vault. To learn more, review the whole authentication flow.</p> <p>Benefits</p> <p>The model of a single mechanism for authentication to both planes has several benefits:</p> <ul> <li>Organizations can centrally control access to all key vaults in their organization.</li> <li>If a user leaves, they instantly lose access to all key vaults in the organization.</li> <li>Organizations can customize authentication by using the options in Azure AD, such as to enable multifactor authentication for added security.</li> </ul> <p>Review a secure Key Vault example</p> <p>In this example, we're developing an application that uses a certificate for SSL, Azure Storage to store data, and an RSA 2,048-bit key for sign operations. Our application runs in an Azure virtual machine (VM) (or a virtual machine scale set). We can use a key vault to store the application secrets. We can store the bootstrap certificate that's used by the application to authenticate with Azure AD.</p> <p>We need access to the following stored keys and secrets:</p> <ul> <li>SSL certificate - Used for SSL.</li> <li>Storage key - Used to access the Storage account.</li> <li>RSA 2,048-bit key - Used for sign operations.</li> <li>Bootstrap certificate - Used to authenticate with Azure AD. After access is granted, we can fetch the storage key and use the RSA key for signing.</li> </ul> <p>We need to define the following roles to specify who can manage, deploy, and audit our application:</p> <ul> <li>Security team - IT staff from the office of the CSO (Chief Security Officer) or similar contributors. The security team is responsible for the proper safekeeping of secrets. The secrets can include SSL certificates, RSA keys for signing, connection strings, and storage account keys.</li> <li>Developers and operators - The staff who develop the application and deploy it in Azure. The members of this team aren't part of the security staff. They shouldn't have access to sensitive data like SSL certificates and RSA keys. Only the application that they deploy should have access to sensitive data.</li> <li>Auditors - This role is for contributors who aren't members of the development or general IT staff. They review the use and maintenance of certificates, keys, and secrets to ensure compliance with security standards.</li> </ul> <p>There is another role that is outside the scope of our application: the subscription (or resource group) administrator. The subscription admin sets up initial access permissions for the security team. They grant access to the security team by using a resource group that has the resources required by the application.</p> <p>Security team</p> <ul> <li>Create key vaults.</li> <li>Turn on Key Vault logging.</li> <li>Add keys and secrets.</li> <li>Create backups of keys for disaster recovery.</li> <li>Set Key Vault access policies to grant permissions to users and applications for specific operations.</li> <li>Roll the keys and secrets periodically.</li> </ul> <p>Developers and operators</p> <ul> <li>Get references from the security team for the bootstrap and SSL certificates (thumbprints), storage key (secret URI), and RSA key (key URI) for signing.</li> <li>Develop and deploy the application to access keys and secrets programmatically.</li> </ul> <p>Auditors</p> <ul> <li>Review the Key Vault logs to confirm proper use of keys and secrets, and compliance with data security standards.</li> </ul> <p>The following table summarizes the access permissions for our roles and application.</p> Role Management plane permissions Data plane permissions Security team Key Vault Contributor Keys: backup, create, delete, get, import, list, restore. Secrets: all operations Developers and operators Key Vault deploy permission Note: This permission allows deployed VMs to fetch secrets from a key vault. None Auditors None Keys: list Secrets: list. Note: This permission enables auditors to inspect attributes (tags, activation dates, expiration dates) for keys and secrets not emitted in the logs. Application None Keys: sign Secrets: get <p>The three team roles need access to other resources along with Key Vault permissions. To deploy VMs (or the Web Apps feature of Azure App Service), developers and operators need Contributor access to those resource types. Auditors need read access to the Storage account where the Key Vault logs are stored.</p> <p>Deploy and manage Key Vault certificates</p> <p>Key Vault certificates support provides for management of your x509 certificates and enables:</p> <ul> <li>A certificate owner to create a certificate through a Key Vault creation process or through the import of an existing certificate. Includes both self-signed and CA-generated certificates.</li> <li>A Key Vault certificate owner to implement secure storage and management of X509 certificates without interaction with private key material.</li> <li>A certificate owner to create a policy that directs Key Vault to manage the life-cycle of a certificate.</li> <li>Certificate owners to provide contact information for notification about lifecycle events of expiration and renewal of certificate.</li> <li>Automatic renewal with selected issuers - Key Vault partner X509 certificate providers and CAs.</li> </ul> <p>When a Key Vault certificate is created, an addressable key and secret are also created with the same name. The Key Vault key allows key operations and the Key Vault secret allows retrieval of the certificate value as a secret. A Key Vault certificate also contains public x509 certificate metadata.</p> <p>The identifier and version of certificates is similar to that of keys and secrets. A specific version of an addressable key and secret created with the Key Vault certificate version is available in the Key Vault certificate response.</p> <p></p> <p>When a Key Vault certificate is created, it can be retrieved from the addressable secret with the private key in either PFX or PEM format. However, the policy used to create the certificate must indicate that the key is exportable. If the policy indicates non-exportable, then the private key isn't a part of the value when retrieved as a secret.</p> <p>The addressable key becomes more relevant with non-exportable Key Vault certificates. The addressable Key Vault key\u2019s operations are mapped from the keyusage field of the Key Vault certificate policy used to create the Key Vault certificate. If a Key Vault certificate expires, it\u2019s addressable key and secret become inoperable.</p> <p>Two types of key are supported \u2013 RSA or RSA HSM with certificates. Exportable is only allowed with RSA, and is not supported by RSA HSM.</p> <p>Certificate policy</p> <p>A certificate policy contains information on how to create and manage the Key Vault certificate lifecycle. When a certificate with private key is imported into the Key Vault, a default policy is created by reading the x509 certificate.</p> <p>When a Key Vault certificate is created from scratch, a policy needs to be supplied. This policy specifies how to create the Key Vault certificate version, or the next Key Vault certificate version. After a policy has been established, it\u2019s not required with successive create operations for future versions. There's only one instance of a policy for all the versions of a Key Vault certificate.</p> <p>At a high level, a certificate policy contains the following information:</p> <ul> <li>X509 certificate properties. Contains subject name, subject alternate names, and other properties used to create an x509 certificate request.</li> <li>Key Properties. Contains key type, key length, exportable, and reuse key fields. These fields instruct key vault on how to generate a key.</li> <li>Secret properties. Contains secret properties such as content type of addressable secret to generate the secret value, for retrieving certificate as a secret.</li> <li>Lifetime Actions. Contains lifetime actions for the Key Vault certificate. Each lifetime action contains:<ul> <li>Trigger, which specifies via days before expiry or lifetime span percentage.</li> <li>Action, which specifies the action type: emailContacts, or autoRenew.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Issuer: Contains the parameters about the certificate issuer to use to issue x509 certificates.</li> <li>Policy attributes: Contains attributes associated with the policy.</li> </ul> <p>Certificate Issuer Before you can create a certificate issuer in a Key Vault, the following two prerequisite steps must be completed successfully:</p> <ol> <li>Onboard to CA providers:<ul> <li>An organization administrator must onboard their company with at least one CA provider.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Admin creates requester credentials for Key Vault to enroll (and renew) SSL certificates:<ul> <li>Provides the configuration to be used to create an issuer object of the provider in the key vault.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>Certificate contacts Certificate contacts contain contact information to send notifications triggered by certificate lifetime events. The contacts information is shared by all the certificates in the key vault. A notification is sent to all the specified contacts for an event for any certificate in the key vault.</p> <p>If a certificate's policy is set to auto renewal, then a notification is sent for the following events:</p> <ul> <li>Before certificate renewal</li> <li>After certificate renewal, and stating if the certificate was successfully renewed, or if there was an error, requiring manual renewal of the certificate</li> <li>When it\u2019s time to renew a certificate for a certificate policy that is set to manually renew (email only)</li> </ul> <p>Certificate access control The Key Vault that contains certificates manages access control for those same certificates. The access control policy for certificates is distinct from the access control policies for keys and secrets in the same Key Vault. Users might create one or more vaults to hold certificates, to maintain scenario appropriate segmentation and management of certificates.</p> <p>The following permissions closely mirror the operations allowed on a secret object, and can be used on a per-principal basis in the secrets access control entry on a key vault:</p> <ul> <li>Permissions for certificate management operations:<ul> <li>get: Get the current certificate version, or any version of a certificate.</li> <li>list: List the current certificates, or versions of a certificate.</li> <li>update: Update a certificate.</li> <li>create: Create a Key Vault certificate.</li> <li>import: Import certificate material into a Key Vault certificate.</li> <li>delete: Delete a certificate, its policy, and all of its versions.</li> <li>recover: Recover a deleted certificate.</li> <li>backup: Back up a certificate in a key vault.</li> <li>restore: Restore a backed-up certificate to a key vault.</li> <li>managecontacts: Manage Key Vault certificate contacts.</li> <li>manageissuers: Manage Key Vault certificate authorities/issuers.</li> <li>getissuers: Get a certificate's authorities/issuers.</li> <li>listissuers: List a certificate's authorities/issuers.</li> <li>setissuers: Create or update a Key Vault certificate's authorities/issuers.</li> <li>deleteissuers: Delete a Key Vault certificate's authorities/issuers.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Permissions for privileged operations:<ul> <li>purge: Purge (permanently delete) a deleted certificate.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Create Key Vault keys</p> <p>Cryptographic keys in Key Vault are represented as JSON Web Key (JWK) objects. There are two types of keys, depending on how they were created.</p> <ul> <li>Soft keys: A key processed in software by Key Vault, but is encrypted at rest using a system key that is in a Hardware Security Module (HSM). Clients may import an existing RSA or EC (Elliptic Curve) key, or request that Key Vault generates one.</li> <li>Hard keys: A key processed in an HSM (Hardware Security Module). These keys are protected in one of the Key Vault HSM Security Worlds (there's one Security World per geography to maintain isolation). Clients may import an RSA or EC key, in soft form or by exporting from a compatible HSM device. Clients may also request Key Vault to generate a key.</li> </ul> <p>Key operations Key Vault supports many operations on key objects. Here are a few:</p> <ul> <li>Create: Allows a client to create a key in Key Vault. The value of the key is generated by Key Vault and stored, and isn't released to the client. Asymmetric keys may be created in Key Vault.</li> <li>Import: Allows a client to import an existing key to Key Vault. Asymmetric keys may be imported to Key Vault using many different packaging methods within a JWK construct.</li> <li>Update: Allows a client with sufficient permissions to modify the metadata (key attributes) associated with a key previously stored within Key Vault.</li> <li>Delete: Allows a client with sufficient permissions to delete a key from Key Vault</li> </ul> <p>Cryptographic operations Once a key has been created in Key Vault, the following cryptographic operations may be performed using the key. For best application performance, verify that operations are performed locally.</p> <ul> <li>Sign and Verify: Strictly, this operation is \"sign hash\" or \"verify hash\", as Key Vault doesn't support hashing of content as part of signature creation. Applications should hash the data to be signed locally, then request that Key Vault signs the hash. Verification of signed hashes is supported as a convenience operation for applications that may not have access to [public] key material.</li> <li>Key Encryption / Wrapping: A key stored in Key Vault may be used to protect another key, typically a symmetric content encryption key (CEK). When the key in Key Vault is asymmetric, key encryption is used. When the key in Key Vault is symmetric, key wrapping is used.</li> <li>Encrypt and Decrypt: A key stored in Key Vault may be used to encrypt or decrypt a single block of data. The size of the block is determined using the key type and selected encryption algorithm. The Encrypt operation is provided for convenience, for applications that may not have access to [public] key material.</li> </ul> <p>Application services plan More organizations are adopting secrets management policies, where secrets are stored centrally with expectations around expiration and access control. Azure Key Vault provides these management capabilities to your applications in Azure, but some applications can\u2019t easily take on code changes to start integrating with it. Key Vault references are a way to introduce secrets management into your app without code changes.</p> <p>Apps hosted in App Service and Azure Functions can now define a reference to a secret managed in Key Vault as part of their application settings. The app\u2019s system-assigned identity is used to securely fetch the secret and make it available to the app as an environment variable. Teams can replace existing secrets stored in app settings with references to the same secret in Key Vault, and the app continues to operate as normal.</p> <p>Configure a hardware security module key-generation solution For added assurance, when you use Azure Key Vault, you can import or generate keys in hardware security modules (HSMs) that never leave the HSM boundary. This scenario is often referred to as Bring Your Own Key (BYOK). The HSMs are FIPS 140-2 Level 2 validated. Azure Key Vault uses Thales nShield family of HSMs to protect your keys. (This functionality isn't available for Azure China.)</p> <p>Generating and transferring an HSM-protected key over the Internet:</p> <ul> <li>You generate the key from an offline workstation, which reduces the attack surface.</li> <li>The key is encrypted with a Key Exchange Key (KEK), which stays encrypted until transferred to the Azure Key Vault HSMs. Only the encrypted version of your key leaves the original workstation.</li> <li>The toolset sets properties on your tenant key that binds your key to the Azure Key Vault security world. After the Azure Key Vault HSMs receive and decrypt your key, only these HSMs can use it. Your key can't be exported. This binding is enforced using the Thales HSMs.</li> <li>The KEK that encrypts your key is generated inside the Azure Key Vault HSMs, and isn't exportable. The HSMs enforce that there can be no clear version of the KEK outside the HSMs. In addition, the toolset includes attestation from Thales that the KEK isn't exportable and was generated inside a genuine HSM manufactured by Thales.</li> <li>The toolset includes attestation from Thales that the Azure Key Vault security world was also generated on a genuine HSM manufactured by Thales.</li> <li>Microsoft uses separate KEKs and separate security worlds in each geographical region. This separation ensures that your key can be used only in data centers in the region in which you encrypted it. For example, a key from a European customer can't be used in data centers in North American or Asia.</li> </ul> <p>Manage customer managed keys Once you have created your Key Vault and have populated it with keys and secrets. The next step is to set up a rotation strategy for the values you store as Key Vault secrets. Secrets can be rotated in several ways:</p> <ul> <li>As part of a manual process</li> <li>Programmatically by using REST API calls</li> <li>Through an Azure Automation script</li> </ul> <p>Example of storage service encryption with customer-managed Keys.</p> <p>This service uses Azure Key Vault that provides highly available and scalable secure storage for RSA cryptographic keys backed by FIPS 140-2 Level 2 validated HSMs (Hardware Security Modules). Key Vault streamlines the key management process and enables customers to maintain control of keys that are used to encrypt data, manage, and audit their key usage, in order to protect sensitive data as part of their regulatory or compliance needs, HIPAA and BAA compliant.</p> <p></p> <p>Customers can generate/import their RSA key to Azure Key Vault and enable Storage Service Encryption. Azure Storage handles the encryption and decryption in a fully transparent fashion using envelope encryption in which data is encrypted using an AES-based key, which in turn is protected using the Customer-Managed Key stored in Azure Key Vault.</p> <p>Customers can rotate their key in Azure Key Vault as per their compliance policies. When they rotate their key, Azure Storage detects the new key version and re-encrypts the Account Encryption Key for that storage account. Key rotation doesn't result in re-encryption of all data and there's no other action required from user.</p> <p>Customers can also revoke access to the storage account by revoking access on their key in Azure Key Vault. There are several ways to revoke access to your keys. Revoking access effectively blocks access to all blobs in the storage account as the Account Encryption Key is inaccessible by Azure Storage.</p> <p>Customers can enable this feature on all available redundancy types of Azure Blob storage including premium storage and can toggle from using Microsoft managed to using customer-managed keys. There's no extra charge for enabling this feature.</p> <p>You can enable this feature on any Azure Resource Manager storage account using the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, or the Microsoft Azure Storage Resource Provider API.</p> <p>Enable Key Vault secrets Key Vault provides secure storage of secrets, such as passwords and database connection strings.</p> <p>From a developer's perspective, Key Vault APIs accept and return secret values as strings. Internally, Key Vault stores and manages secrets as sequences of octets (8-bit bytes), with a maximum size of 25k bytes each. The Key Vault service doesn't provide semantics for secrets. It merely accepts the data, encrypts it, stores it, and returns a secret identifier (\"ID\"). The identifier can be used to retrieve the secret at a later time.</p> <p>For highly sensitive data, clients should consider additional layers of protection for data. Encrypting data using a separate protection key prior to storage in Key Vault is one example.</p> <p>Key Vault also supports a contentType field for secrets. Clients may specify the content type of a secret to assist in interpreting the secret data when it's retrieved. The maximum length of this field is 255 characters. There are no pre-defined values. The suggested usage is as a hint for interpreting the secret data. For instance, an implementation may store both passwords and certificates as secrets, then use this field to differentiate. There are no predefined values.</p> <p></p> <p>As shown above, the values for Key Vault Secrets are:</p> <ul> <li>Name-value pair - Name must be unique in the Vault</li> <li>Value can be any Unicode Transformation Format (UTF-8) string - max of 25 KB in size</li> <li>Manual or certificate creation</li> <li>Activation date</li> <li>Expiration date</li> </ul> <p>Encryption All secrets in your Key Vault are stored encrypted. Key Vault encrypts secrets at rest with a hierarchy of encryption keys, with all keys in that hierarchy are protected by modules that are Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-2 compliant. This encryption is transparent, and requires no action from the user. The Azure Key Vault service encrypts your secrets when you add them, and decrypts them automatically when you read them.</p> <p>The encryption leaf key of the key hierarchy is unique to each key vault. The encryption root key of the key hierarchy is unique to the security world, and its protection level varies between regions:</p> <ul> <li>China: root key is protected by a module that is validated for FIPS 140-2 Level 1.</li> <li>Other regions: root key is protected by a module that is validated for FIPS 140-2 Level 2 or higher.</li> </ul> <p>Secret attributes In addition to the secret data, the following attributes may be specified:</p> <ul> <li>exp: IntDate, optional, default is forever. The exp (expiration time) attribute identifies the expiration time on or after which the secret data SHOULD NOT be retrieved, except in particular situations. This field is for informational purposes only as it informs users of key vault service that a particular secret may not be used. Its value MUST be a number containing an IntDate value.</li> <li>nbf: IntDate, optional, default is now. The nbf (not before) attribute identifies the time before which the secret data SHOULD NOT be retrieved, except in particular situations. This field is for informational purposes only. Its value MUST be a number containing an IntDate value.</li> <li>enabled: boolean, optional, default is true. This attribute specifies whether the secret data can be retrieved. The enabled attribute is used with nbf and exp when an operation occurs between nbf and exp, it will only be permitted if enabled is set to true. Operations outside the nbf and exp window are automatically disallowed, except in particular situations.</li> </ul> <p>There are more read-only attributes that are included in any response that includes secret attributes:</p> <ul> <li>created: IntDate, optional. The created attribute indicates when this version of the secret was created. This value is null for secrets created prior to the addition of this attribute. Its value must be a number containing an IntDate value.</li> <li>updated: IntDate, optional. The updated attribute indicates when this version of the secret was updated. This value is null for secrets that were last updated prior to the addition of this attribute. Its value must be a number containing an IntDate value.</li> </ul> <p>For information on common attributes for each key vault object type, see Azure Key Vault keys, secrets and certificates overview.</p> <p>Date-time controlled operations A secret's get operation will work for not-yet-valid and expired secrets, outside the nbf / exp window. Calling a secret's get operation, for a not-yet-valid secret, can be used for test purposes. Retrieving (getting) an expired secret, can be used for recovery operations.</p> <p>Secret access control Access Control for secrets managed in Key Vault, is provided at the level of the Key Vault that contains those secrets. The access control policy for secrets is distinct from the access control policy for keys in the same Key Vault. Users may create one or more vaults to hold secrets, and are required to maintain scenario appropriate segmentation and management of secrets.</p> <p>The following permissions can be used, on a per-principal basis, in the secrets access control entry on a vault, and closely mirror the operations allowed on a secret object:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Permissions for secret management operations</p> <ul> <li>get: Read a secret</li> <li>list: List the secrets or versions of a secret stored in a Key Vault</li> <li>set: Create a secret</li> <li>delete: Delete a secret</li> <li>recover: Recover a deleted secret</li> <li>backup: Back up a secret in a key vault</li> <li>restore: Restore a backed up secret to a key vault</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Permissions for privileged operations</p> <ul> <li>purge: Purge (permanently delete) a deleted secret</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Secret tags You can specify more application-specific metadata in the form of tags. Key Vault supports up to 15 tags, each of which can have a 256 character name and a 256 character value.</p> <pre><code> Note\n\nTags are readable by a caller if they have the list or get permission.\n</code></pre> <p>Usage Scenarios</p> When to use Examples Securely store, manage lifecycle, and monitor credentials for service-to-service communication like passwords, access keys, service principal client secrets. Use Azure Key Vault with a Virtual MachineUse Azure Key Vault with an Azure Web Application <p>Configure key rotation Once you have keys and secrets stored in the key vault it's important to think about a rotation strategy. There are several ways to rotate the values:</p> <ul> <li>As part of a manual process</li> <li>Programmatically by using API calls</li> <li>Through an Azure Automation script</li> </ul> <p>This diagram shows how Event Grid and Function Apps can be used to automate the process.</p> <p></p> <ol> <li>Thirty days before the expiration date of a secret, Key Vault publishes the \"near expiry\" event to Event Grid.</li> <li>Event Grid checks the event subscriptions and uses HTTP POST to call the function app endpoint subscribed to the event.</li> <li>The function app receives the secret information, generates a new random password, and creates a new version for the secret with the new password in Key Vault.</li> <li>The function app updates SQL Server with the new password.</li> </ol> <p>Manage Key Vault safety and recovery features Key Vault's soft-delete feature allows recovery of the deleted vaults and deleted key vault objects (for example, keys, secrets, certificates), known as soft-delete. Specifically, we address the following scenarios: This safeguard offer the following protections:</p> <ul> <li>Once a secret, key, certificate, or key vault is deleted, it remains recoverable for a configurable period of 7 to 90 calendar days. If no configuration is specified, the default recovery period is set to 90 days. Users are provided with sufficient time to notice an accidental secret deletion and respond.</li> <li>Two operations must be made to permanently delete a secret. First a user must delete the object, which puts it into the soft-deleted state. Second, a user must purge the object in the soft-deleted state. The purge operation requires extra access policy permissions. These extra protections reduce the risk of a user accidentally or maliciously deleting a secret or a key vault.</li> <li>To purge a secret in the soft-deleted state, a service principal must be granted another \"purge\" access policy permission. The purge access policy permission isn't granted by default to any service principal including key vault and subscription owners and must be deliberately set. By requiring an elevated access policy permission to purge a soft-deleted secret, it reduces the probability of accidentally deleting a secret.</li> </ul> <p>Supporting interfaces The soft-delete feature is available through the REST API, the Azure CLI, PowerShell, .NET/C# interfaces, and ARM templates.</p> <p>Scenarios Azure Key Vaults are tracked resources, managed by Azure Resource Manager. Azure Resource Manager also specifies a well-defined behavior for deletion, which requires that a successful DELETE operation must result in that resource not being accessible anymore. The soft-delete feature addresses the recovery of the deleted object, whether the deletion was accidental or intentional.</p> <ol> <li>In the typical scenario, a user may have inadvertently deleted a key vault or a key vault object. If that key vault or key vault object were to be recoverable for a predetermined period, the user may undo the deletion and recover their data.</li> <li>In a different scenario, a rogue user may attempt to delete a key vault or a key vault object, such as a key inside a vault, to cause a business disruption. Separation and deletion of the key vault or key vault object from the actual deletion of the underlying data can be used as a safety measure by, for instance, restricting permissions on data deletion to a different, trusted role. This approach effectively requires quorum for an operation that might otherwise result in an immediate data loss.</li> </ol> <p>Soft-delete behavior When soft-delete is enabled, resources marked as deleted resources are retained for a specified period (90 days by default). The service further provides a mechanism for recovering the deleted object, essentially undoing the deletion.</p> <p>When creating a new key vault, soft-delete is on by default. Once soft-delete is enabled on a key vault, it can't be disabled.</p> <p>The default retention period is 90 days but, during key vault creation, it's possible to set the retention policy interval to a value from 7 to 90 days through the Azure portal. The purge protection retention policy uses the same interval. Once set, the retention policy interval can't be changed.</p> <p>You can't reuse the name of a key vault that has been soft-deleted until the retention period has passed.</p> <p>Purge protection Permanently deleting, purging, a key vault is possible via a POST operation on the proxy resource and requires special privileges. Generally, only the subscription owner is able to purge a key vault. The POST operation triggers the immediate and irrecoverable deletion of that vault.</p> <p>Exceptions are:</p> <ul> <li>When the Azure subscription has been marked as undeletable. In this case, only the service may then perform the actual deletion, and does so as a scheduled process.</li> <li>When the enable-purge-protection argument is enabled on the vault itself. In this case, Key Vault waits for 90 days from when the original secret object was marked for deletion to permanently delete the object.</li> </ul> <p>Key vault recovery Upon deleting a key vault object, such as a key, the service will place the object in a deleted state, making it inaccessible to any retrieval operations. While in this state, the key vault object can only be listed, recovered, or forcefully/permanently deleted. To view the objects, use the Azure CLI az keyvault key list-deleted command, or the PowerShell Get-AzKeyVault -InRemovedState command.</p> <p>At the same time, Key Vault will schedule the deletion of the underlying data corresponding to the deleted key vault or key vault object for execution after a predetermined retention interval. The DNS record corresponding to the vault is also retained during the retention interval.</p> <p>Soft-delete retention period Soft-deleted resources are retained for a set period of time, 90 days. During the soft-delete retention interval, the following apply:</p> <ul> <li>You may list all of the key vaults and key vault objects in the soft-delete state for your subscription as well as access deletion and recovery information about them.<ul> <li>Only users with special permissions can list deleted vaults. We recommend that our users create a custom role with these special permissions for handling deleted vaults.</li> </ul> </li> <li>A key vault with the same name can't be created in the same location; correspondingly, a key vault object can't be created in a given vault if that key vault contains an object with the same name and which is in a deleted state.</li> <li>Only a privileged user may restore a key vault or key vault object by issuing a recover command on the corresponding proxy resource.<ul> <li>The user, member of the custom role, who has the privilege to create a key vault under the resource group can restore the vault.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Only a privileged user may forcibly delete a key vault or key vault object by issuing a delete command on the corresponding proxy resource.</li> </ul> <p>Unless a key vault or key vault object is recovered, at the end of the retention interval the service performs a purge of the soft-deleted key vault or key vault object and its content. Resource deletion may not be rescheduled.</p> <p>Billing implications In general, when an object (a key vault or a key or a secret) is in deleted state, there are only two operations possible: 'purge' and 'recover'. All the other operations fail. Therefore, even though the object exists, no operations can be performed and hence no usage will occur, so no bill. However there are following exceptions:</p> <ul> <li>In general, when an object (a key vault or a key or a secret) is in deleted state, there are only two operations possible: 'purge' and 'recover'. All the other operations fail. Therefore, even though the object exists, no operations can be performed and hence no usage will occur, so no bill. However there are following exceptions:</li> <li>If the object is an HSM-key, the 'HSM Protected key' charge per key version per month charge applies if a key version has been used in last 30 days. After that, since the object is in deleted state no operations can be performed against it, so no charge will apply.</li> </ul> <p>Key vault soft-delete on by default If a secret is deleted and the key vault doesn't have soft-deleted protection, it's deleted permanently. Although users can currently opt out of soft-delete during key vault creation, this ability is deprecated. In February 2025, Microsoft enables soft-delete protection on all key vaults, and users are no longer be able to opt out of or turn off soft-delete. This, protect secrets from accidental or malicious deletion by a user.</p> <p>This diagram shows how the process flow of deleting a key with and without soft-delete protection.</p> <p></p> <p>When a secret is deleted from a key vault without soft-delete protection, the secret is permanently deleted. Users can currently opt out of soft-delete during key vault creation. However, Microsoft enables soft-delete protection on all key vaults to protect secrets from accidental or malicious deletion by a user. Users are no longer be able to opt out of or turn off soft-delete.</p> <p>Key vault backup Azure Key Vault automatically provides features to help you maintain availability and prevent data loss. Back up secrets only if you have a critical business justification. Backing up secrets in your key vault may introduce operational challenges such as maintaining multiple sets of logs, permissions, and backups when secrets expire or rotate.</p> <p>Key Vault maintains availability in disaster scenarios and will automatically fail over requests to a paired region without any intervention from a user.</p> <p>If you want protection against accidental or malicious deletion of your secrets, configure soft-delete and purge protection features on your key vault.</p> <p>Limitations</p> <pre><code>Important\n\nKey Vault does not support the ability to backup more than 500 past versions of a key, secret, or certificate object. Attempting to backup a key, secret, or certificate object may result in an error. It is not possible to delete previous versions of a key, secret, or certificate.\n</code></pre> <p>Key Vault doesn't currently provide a way to back up an entire key vault in a single operation. Any attempt to use the commands listed in this document to do an automated backup of a key vault may result in errors and not supported by Microsoft or the Azure Key Vault team.</p> <p>Also consider the following consequences:</p> <ul> <li>Backing up secrets that have multiple versions might cause time-out errors.</li> <li>A backup creates a point-in-time snapshot. Secrets might renew during a backup, causing a mismatch of encryption keys.</li> <li>If you exceed key vault service limits for requests per second, your key vault is throttled, and the backup fails.</li> </ul> <p>Design considerations When you back up a key vault object, such as a secret, key, or certificate, the backup operation downloads the object as an encrypted blob.

It allows developers to build applications that sign in users, get tokens to call APIs, such as Microsoft Graph or APIs that developers have built. It consists of an authentication service, open-source libraries, application registration and configuration (through a developer portal and application API), full developer documentation, quickstart samples, code samples, tutorials, how-to guides, and other developer content. The Microsoft identity platform supports industry-standard protocols such as OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect.</p> <p>Up until now, most developers have worked with the Azure AD v1.0 platform to authenticate work and school accounts (provisioned by Azure AD) by requesting tokens from the Azure AD v1.0 endpoint, using Azure AD Authentication Library (ADAL), Azure portal for application registration and configuration, and the Microsoft Graph API for programmatic application configuration.</p> <p>With the unified Microsoft identity platform (v2.0), you can write code once and authenticate any Microsoft identity into your application. For several platforms, the fully supported open-source Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) is recommended for use against the identity platform endpoints. MSAL is simple to use, provides great single sign-on (SSO) experiences for your users, helps you achieve high reliability and performance, and is developed using Microsoft Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL). When calling APIs, you can configure your application to take advantage of incremental consent, which allows you to delay the request for consent for more invasive scopes until the application\u2019s usage warrants this at runtime. MSAL also supports Azure Active Directory B2C, so your customers use their preferred social, enterprise, or local account identities to get single sign-on access to your applications and APIs.</p> <p>With the Microsoft identity platform, one can expand their reach to these kinds of users:</p> <ul> <li>Work and school accounts (Azure AD provisioned accounts)</li> <li>Personal accounts (such as Outlook.com or Hotmail.com)</li> <li>Your customers who bring their own email or social identity (such as LinkedIn, Facebook, and Google) via MSAL and Azure AD business-to-consumer (B2C)</li> </ul> <p>You can use the Azure portal to register and configure your application and use the Microsoft Graph API for programmatic application configuration.</p> <p>Microsoft identity platform</p> <p>The following diagram depicts the Microsoft identity experience at a high level, including the app registration experience, software development kits (SDKs), endpoints, and supported identities.</p> <p></p> <p>The Microsoft identity platform has two endpoints (v1.0 and v2.0); however, when developing a new application, consider it's highly recommended that you use the v2.0 (default) endpoint to benefit from the latest features and capabilities:</p> <p>The Microsoft Authentication Library can be used in many application scenarios, including the following:</p> <ul> <li>Single-page applications (JavaScript)</li> <li>Web app signing in users</li> <li>Web application signing in a user and calling a web API on behalf of the user</li> <li>Protecting a web API so only authenticated users can access it</li> <li>Web API calling another downstream Web API on behalf of the signed-in user</li> <li>Desktop application calling a web API on behalf of the signed-in user</li> <li>Mobile application calling a web API on behalf of the user who's signed in interactively.</li> <li>Desktop/service daemon application calling web API on behalf of itself</li> </ul> <p>Languages and frameworks</p> Library Supported platforms and frameworks MSAL for Android Android MSAL   Angular Single-page apps with Angular and Angular.js frameworks MSAL for iOS and macOS iOS and macOS MSAL Go (Preview) Windows, macOS, Linux MSAL Java Windows, macOS, Linux MSAL.js JavaScript/TypeScript frameworks such as Vue.js, Ember.js, or Durandal.js MSAL.NET .NET Framework, .NET Core, Xamarin Android, Xamarin iOS, Universal   Windows Platform MSAL Node Web apps with Express, desktop apps with Electron, Cross-platform console   apps MSAL Python Windows, macOS, Linux MSAL React Single-page apps with React and React-based libraries (Next.js,   Gatsby.js) <p>Migrate apps that use ADAL to MSAL</p> <p>Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) integrates with the Azure AD for developers (v1.0) endpoint, where MSAL integrates with the Microsoft identity platform. The v1.0 endpoint supports work accounts but not personal accounts. The v2.0 endpoint is unifying Microsoft personal accounts and works accounts into a single authentication system. Additionally, with MSAL, you can also get authentications for Azure AD B2C.</p> <p>Explore Azure AD application scenarios</p> <p>Any application that outsources authentication to Azure AD needs to be registered in a directory. This step involves telling Azure AD about your application, including:</p> <p>Azure AD application scenarios</p> Frontend Authentication Backend Single page application are frontends   that run in a browser Azure AD Authorization Endpoint Web API Web apps are applications that   authenticate a user in a web browser to a web application Azure AD WS-Federation or SAML Endpoint Web application Native   apps are applications that call a web API on behalf of a user Azure AD Authorization Endpoint and Azure AD Token Endpoint Web API Web API apps are web applications that   need to get resources from a web API Azure AD Authorization Endpoint and Azure AD Token Endpoint Web application and Web API Service-to-service applications are   daemon or server application that needs to get resources from a web API Azure AD Authorization Endpoint and Azure AD Token Endpoint Web API <p>Azure AD represents applications following a specific model that's designed to fulfill two main functions:</p> <ul> <li>Identify the app according to the authentication protocols it supports. This involves enumerating all the identifiers, URLs, secrets, and related information that Azure AD needs at authentication time. Here, Azure AD:<ul> <li>Holds all the data needed to support authentication at run time.</li> <li>Holds all the data for deciding which resources an app might need to access, whether it should fulfill a particular request, and under what circumstances it should fulfill the request.</li> <li>Supplies the infrastructure for implementing app provisioning both within the app developer's tenant and to any other Azure AD tenant.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Handle user consent during token request time and facilitate the dynamic provisioning of apps across tenants. Here, Azure AD:<ul> <li>Enables users and administrators to dynamically grant or deny consent for the app to access resources on their behalf.</li> <li>Enables administrators to ultimately decide what apps are allowed to do, which users can use specific apps, and how directory resources are accessed.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>In Azure AD, an application object describes an application as an abstract entity. Developers work with applications. At deployment time, Azure AD uses a specific application object as a blueprint to create a service principal, which represents a concrete instance of an application within a directory or tenant. It's the service principal that defines what the app can do in a specific target directory, who can use it, what resources it has access to, and so on. Azure AD creates a service principal from an application object through consent.</p> <p>The following diagram depicts a simplified Azure AD provisioning flow driven by consent.</p> <p></p> <p>In this provisioning flow:</p> <ol> <li>A user from B tries to sign in with the app.</li> <li>Azure AD gets and verifies the user credentials.</li> <li>Azure AD prompts the user to consent for the app to gain access to tenant B.</li> <li>Azure AD uses the application object in A as a blueprint for creating a service principal in B.</li> <li>The user receives the requested token.</li> </ol> <p>You can repeat this process as many times as you want for other tenants (C, D, and so on). Directory A keeps the blueprint for the app (application object). Users and admins of all the other tenants where the app is given consent to retain control over what the application can do through the corresponding service principal object in each tenant.</p> <p>When an application is given permission to access resources in a tenant (upon registration or consent), a service principal object is created. The Microsoft Graph ServicePrincipal entity defines the schema for a service principal object's properties.</p> <p>Register an application with App Registration For the most secure operation, register your app with the Microsoft identity platform.</p> <p>Before your app can get a token from the Microsoft identity platform, it must be registered in the Azure portal. Registration integrates your app with the Microsoft identity platform and establishes the information that it uses to get tokens, including:</p> <ul> <li>Application ID: A unique identifier assigned by the Microsoft identity platform.</li> <li>Redirect URI/URL: One or more endpoints at which your app will receive responses from the Microsoft identity platform. (For native and mobile apps, this is a URI assigned by the Microsoft identity platform.)</li> <li>Application Secret: A password or a public/private key pair that your app uses to authenticate with the Microsoft identity platform. (Not needed for native or mobile apps.)</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Getting an access token</p> <p>Like most developers, you will probably use authentication libraries to manage your token interactions with the Microsoft identity platform. Authentication libraries abstract many protocol details, like validation, cookie handling, token caching, and maintaining secure connections, away from the developer and let you focus your development on your app. Microsoft publishes open-source client libraries and server middleware.</p> <p>Configure Microsoft Graph permissions</p> <p>Microsoft Graph exposes granular permissions that control the access that apps have to resources, like users, groups, and mail. As a developer, you decide which permissions to request for Microsoft Graph. When a user signs in to your app they, or, in some cases, an administrator, are given a chance to consent to these permissions. If the user consents, your app is given access to the resources and APIs that it has requested. For apps that don't take a signed-in user, permissions can be pre-consented to by an administrator when the app is installed.</p> <p>Microsoft Graph has two types of permissions:</p> <ul> <li>Delegated permissions are used by apps that have a signed-in user present. For these apps, either the user or an administrator consents to the permissions that the app requests, and the app can act as the signed-in user when making calls to Microsoft Graph. Some delegated permissions can be consented by non-administrative users, but some higher-privileged permissions require administrator consent.</li> <li>Application permissions are used by apps that run without a signed-in user present; for example, apps that run as background services or daemons. Application permissions can only be consented by an administrator.</li> </ul> <p>Effective permissions are the permissions that your app will have when making requests to Microsoft Graph. It is important to understand the difference between the delegated and application permissions that your app is granted and its effective permissions when making calls to Microsoft Graph.</p> <p>For delegated permissions, the effective permissions of your app will be the intersection of the delegated permissions the app has been granted (via consent) and the privileges of the currently signed-in user. Your app can never have more privileges than the signed-in user. Within organizations, the privileges of the signed-in user can be determined by policy or by membership in one or more administrator roles.</p> <p>For example, assume your app has been granted the User.ReadWrite.All delegated permission. This permission nominally grants your app permission to read and update the profile of every user in an organization. If the signed-in user is a global administrator, your app will be able to update the profile of every user in the organization. However, if the signed-in user is not in an administrator role, your app will be able to update only the profile of the signed-in user. It will not be able to update the profiles of other users in the organization because the user that it has permission to act on behalf of does not have those privileges. For application permissions, the effective permissions of your app will be the full level of privileges implied by the permission. For example, an app that has the User.ReadWrite.All application permission can update the profile of every user in the organization.</p> <p></p> <p>Microsoft Graph API</p> <p>You can use the Microsoft Graph Security API to connect Microsoft security products, services, and partners to streamline security operations and improve threat protection, detection, and response capabilities. The Microsoft Graph Security API is an intermediary service (or broker) that provides a single programmatic interface to connect multiple Microsoft Graph Security providers (also called security providers or providers). The Microsoft Graph Security API federates requests to all providers in the Microsoft Graph Security ecosystem. This is based on the security provider consent provided by the application, as shown in the following diagram. The consent workflow only applies to non-Microsoft providers.</p> <p></p> <p>The following is a description of the flow:</p> <ol> <li>The application user signs in to the provider application to view the consent form from the provider. This consent form experience or UI is owned by the provider and applies to non-Microsoft providers only to get explicit consent from their customers to send requests to Microsoft Graph Security API.</li> <li>The client consent is stored on the provider side.</li> <li>The provider consent service calls the Microsoft Graph Security API to inform consent approval for the respective customer.</li> <li>The application sends a request to the Microsoft Graph Security API.</li> <li>The Microsoft Graph Security API checks for the consent information for this customer mapped to various providers.</li> <li>The Microsoft Graph Security API calls all those providers the customer has given explicit consent to via the provider consent experience.</li> <li>The response is returned from all the consented providers for that client.</li> <li>The result set response is returned to the application.</li> <li>If the customer has not consented to any provider, no results from those providers are included in the response.</li> </ol> <p>The Microsoft Graph Security API makes it easy to connect with security solutions from Microsoft and partners. It allows you to more readily realize and enrich the value of these solutions. You can connect easily with the Microsoft Graph Security API by using one of the following approaches, depending on your requirements:</p> <p>Why use the Microsoft Graph Security API?</p> <ul> <li>Write code \u2013 Find code samples in C#, Java, NodeJS, and more.</li> <li>Connect using scripts \u2013 Find PowerShell samples.</li> <li>Drag and drop into workflows and playbooks \u2013 Use Microsoft Graph Security connectors for Azure Logic Apps, Microsoft Flow, and PowerApps.</li> <li>Get data into reports and dashboards \u2013 Use the Microsoft Graph Security connector for Power BI.</li> <li>Connect using Jupyter notebooks \u2013 Find Jupyter notebook samples.</li> </ul> <p>Unify and standardize alert tracking Connect once to integrate alerts from any Microsoft Graph-integrated security solution and keep alert status and assignments in sync across all solutions. You can also stream alerts to security information and event management (SIEM) solutions, such as Splunk using Microsoft Graph Security API connectors.</p> <p>Correlate security alerts to improve threat protection and response Correlate alerts across security solutions more easily with a unified alert schema. This not only allows you to receive actionable alert information but allows security analysts to pivot and enrich alerts with asset and user information, enabling faster response to threats and asset protection.</p> <p>Update alert tags, status, and assignments Tag alerts with additional context or threat intelligence to inform response and remediation. Ensure that comments and feedback on alerts are captured for visibility to all workflows. Keep alert status and assignments in sync so that all integrated solutions reflect the current state. Use webhook subscriptions to get notified of changes.</p> <p>Unlock security context to drive investigation Dive deep into related security-relevant inventory (like users, hosts, and apps), then add organizational context from other Microsoft Graph providers (Azure AD, Microsoft Intune, Microsoft 365) to bring business and security contexts together and improve threat response.</p> <p>Enable managed identities A common challenge when building cloud applications is how to manage the credentials in your code for authenticating to cloud services. Keeping the credentials secure is an important task. Ideally, the credentials never appear on developer workstations and aren't checked into source control. Azure Key Vault provides a way to securely store credentials, secrets, and other keys, but your code has to authenticate to Key Vault to retrieve them.</p> <p>Managed Identities for Azure resources is the new name for the service formerly known as Managed Service Identity (MSI) for Azure resources feature in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) solves the above noted problem. The feature provides Azure services with an automatically managed identity in Azure AD. You can use the identity to authenticate to any service that supports Azure AD authentication, including Key Vault, without any credentials in your code.</p> <p>The managed identities for Azure resources feature is free with Azure AD for Azure subscriptions. There's no additional cost.</p> <p>Terminology The following terms are used throughout the managed identities for Azure resources documentation set:</p> <ul> <li>Client ID - a unique identifier generated by Azure AD that is tied to an application and service principal during its initial provisioning.</li> <li>Principal ID - the object ID of the service principal object for your managed identity that is used to grant role-based access to an Azure resource.</li> <li>Azure Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) - a REST endpoint accessible to all IaaS VMs created via the Azure Resource Manager. The endpoint is available at a well-known non-routable IP address (169.254.169.254) that can be accessed only from within the VM.</li> </ul> <p>How managed identities for Azure resources works There are two types of managed identities:</p> <ul> <li>A system-assigned managed identity is enabled directly on an Azure service instance. When the identity is enabled, Azure creates an identity for the instance in the Azure AD tenant that's trusted by the subscription of the instance. After the identity is created, the credentials are provisioned onto the instance. The lifecycle of a system-assigned identity is directly tied to the Azure service instance that it's enabled on. If the instance is deleted, Azure automatically cleans up the credentials and the identity in Azure AD.</li> <li>A user-assigned managed identity is created as a standalone Azure resource. Through a create process, Azure creates an identity in the Azure AD tenant that's trusted by the subscription in use. After the identity is created, the identity can be assigned to one or more Azure service instances. The lifecycle of a user-assigned identity is managed separately from the lifecycle of the Azure service instances to which it's assigned.</li> </ul> <p>Internally, managed identities are service principals of a special type, which are locked to only be used with Azure resources. When the managed identity is deleted, the corresponding service principal is automatically removed. Also, when a User-Assigned or System-Assigned Identity is created, the Managed Identity Resource Provider (MSRP) issues a certificate internally to that identity.</p> <p>Your code can use a managed identity to request access tokens for services that support Azure AD authentication. Azure takes care of rolling the credentials that are used by the service instance.</p> <p>Credential rotation</p> <p>Credential rotation is controlled by the resource provider that hosts the Azure resource. The default rotation of the credential occurs every 46 days. It's up to the resource provider to call for new credentials, so the resource provider could wait longer than 46 days.</p> <p>The following diagram shows how managed service identities work with Azure virtual machines (VMs):</p> <p></p> <p>How a system-assigned managed identity works with an Azure VM</p> <ol> <li>Azure Resource Manager receives a request to enable the system-assigned managed identity on a VM.</li> <li>Azure Resource Manager creates a service principal in Azure AD for the identity of the VM. The service principal is created in the Azure AD tenant that's trusted by the subscription.</li> <li>Azure Resource Manager configures the identity on the VM by updating the Azure Instance Metadata Service identity endpoint with the service principal client ID and certificate.</li> <li>After the VM has an identity, use the service principal information to grant the VM access to Azure resources. To call Azure Resource Manager, use role-based access control (RBAC) in Azure AD to assign the appropriate role to the VM service principal. To call Key Vault, grant your code access to the specific secret or key in Key Vault.</li> <li> <p>Your code that's running on the VM can request a token from the Azure Instance Metadata service endpoint, accessible only from within the VM: http://169.254.169.254/metadata/identity/oauth2/token</p> <ul> <li>The resource parameter specifies the service to which the token is sent. To authenticate to Azure Resource Manager, use resource=https://management.azure.com/.</li> <li>API version parameter specifies the IMDS version, use api-version=2018-02-01 or greater.</li> <li>A call is made to Azure AD to request an access token (as specified in step 5) by using the client ID and certificate configured in step 3. Azure AD returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) access token.</li> <li>Your code sends the access token on a call to a service that supports Azure AD authentication</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>Azure App Services</p> <p>Azure App Service is an HTTP-based service for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile backends. You can develop in your favorite language, be it .NET, .NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, or Python. Applications run and scale with ease on both Windows and Linux-based environments.</p> <p>App Service not only adds the power of Microsoft Azure to your application, such as security, load balancing, autoscaling, and automated management. You can also use its DevOps capabilities, such as continuous deployment from Azure DevOps, GitHub, Docker Hub, and other sources, package management, staging environments, custom domain, and TLS/SSL certificates.</p> <p>With App Service, you pay for the Azure compute resources you use. The compute resources you use are determined by the App Service plan that you run your apps on. For more information, see Azure App Service plans overview.</p> <p>Why use App Service?</p> <p>Azure App Service is a fully managed platform as a service (PaaS) offering for developers. Here are some key features of App Service:</p> <ul> <li>Multiple languages and frameworks - App Service has first-class support for ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, or Python. You can also run PowerShell and other scripts or executables as background services.</li> <li>Managed production environment - App Service automatically patches and maintains the OS and language frameworks for you. Spend time writing great apps and let Azure worry about the platform.</li> <li>Containerization and Docker - Dockerize your app and host a custom Windows or Linux container in App Service. Run multi-container apps with Docker Compose. Migrate your Docker skills directly to App Service.</li> <li>DevOps optimization - Set up continuous integration and deployment with Azure DevOps, GitHub, BitBucket, Docker Hub, or Azure Container Registry. Promote updates through test and staging environments. Manage your apps in App Service by using Azure PowerShell or the cross-platform command-line interface (CLI).</li> <li>Global scale with high availability - Scale up or out manually or automatically. Host your apps anywhere in Microsoft's global data center infrastructure, and the App Service SLA promises high availability.</li> <li>Connections to SaaS platforms and on-premises data - Choose from more than 50 connectors for enterprise systems (such as SAP), SaaS services (such as Salesforce), and internet services (such as Facebook). Access on-premises data using Hybrid Connections and Azure Virtual Networks.</li> <li>Security and compliance - The App Service is ISO, SOC, and PCI compliant. Authenticate users with Azure Active Directory, Google, Facebook, Twitter, or Microsoft account. Create IP address restrictions and manage service identities. Prevent subdomain takeovers.</li> <li>Application templates - Choose from an extensive list of application templates in the Azure Marketplace, such as WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal.</li> <li>Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code integration - Dedicated tools in Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code streamline the work of creating, deploying, and debugging.</li> <li>API and mobile features - App Service provides turn-key CORS support for RESTful API scenarios and simplifies mobile app scenarios by enabling authentication, offline data sync, push notifications, and more.</li> <li>Serverless code - Run a code snippet or script on-demand without having to explicitly provision or manage infrastructure and pay only for the compute time your code actually uses.</li> </ul> <p>Besides App Service, Azure offers other services that can be used for hosting websites and web applications. For most scenarios, App Service is the best choice.</p> <p>App Service Environment</p> <p>An App Service Environment is an Azure App Service feature that provides a fully isolated and dedicated environment for running App Service apps securely at high scale.</p> <p>An App Service Environment can host:</p> <ul> <li>Windows web apps</li> <li>Linux web apps</li> <li>Docker containers (Windows and Linux)</li> <li>Functions</li> <li>Logic apps (Standard)</li> </ul> <p>App Service Environments are appropriate for application workloads that require:</p> <ul> <li>High scale.</li> <li>Isolation and secure network access.</li> <li>High memory utilization.</li> <li>High requests per second (RPS). You can create multiple App Service Environments in a single Azure region or across multiple Azure regions. This flexibility makes an App Service Environment ideal for horizontally scaling stateless applications with a high RPS requirement.</li> </ul> <p>An App Service Environment can host applications from only one customer, and they do so on one of their virtual networks. Customers have fine-grained control over inbound and outbound application network traffic. Applications can establish high-speed secure connections over VPNs to on-premises corporate resources.</p> <p>Usage scenarios</p> <p>App Service Environments have many use cases, including:</p> <ul> <li>Internal line-of-business applications.</li> <li>Applications that need more than 30 App Service plan instances.</li> <li>Single-tenant systems to satisfy internal compliance or security requirements.</li> <li>Network-isolated application hosting.</li> <li>Multi-tier applications.</li> </ul> <p>There are many networking features that enable apps in a multi-tenant App Service to reach network-isolated resources or become network-isolated themselves. These features are enabled at the application level. With an App Service Environment, no added configuration is required for the apps to be on a virtual network. The apps are deployed into a network-isolated environment that's already on a virtual network. If you really need a complete isolation story, you can also deploy your App Service Environment onto dedicated hardware.</p> <p>Dedicated environment</p> <p>An App Service Environment is a single-tenant deployment of Azure App Service that runs on your virtual network.</p> <p>Applications are hosted in App Service plans, which are created in an App Service Environment. An App Service plan is essentially a provisioning profile for an application host. As you scale out your App Service plan, you create more application hosts with all the apps in that App Service plan on each host. A single App Service Environment v3 can have up to 200 total App Service plan instances across all the App Service plans combined. A single App Service Isolated v2 (Iv2) plan can have up to 100 instances by itself.</p> <p>When you're deploying onto dedicated hardware (hosts), you're limited in scaling across all App Service plans to the number of cores in this type of environment. An App Service Environment that's deployed on dedicated hosts has 132 vCores available. I1v2 uses two vCores, I2v2 uses four vCores, and I3v2 uses eight vCores per instance.</p> <p>Azure App Service plan</p> <p>An app service always runs in an App Serviceplan. In addition, Azure Functions also has the option of running in an App Service plan. An App Service plan defines a set of compute resources for a web app to run. These compute resources are analogous to the server farm in conventional web hosting. One or more apps can be configured to run on the same computing resources (or in the same App Service plan).</p> <p>When you create an App Service plan in a certain region (for example, West Europe), a set of compute resources is created for that plan in that region. Whatever apps you put into this App Service plan run on these compute resources as defined by your App Service plan. Each App Service plan defines:</p> <ul> <li>Operating System (Windows, Linux)</li> <li>Region (West US, East US, etc.)</li> <li>Number of VM instances</li> <li>Size of VM instances (Small, Medium, Large)</li> <li>Pricing tier (Free, Shared, Basic, Standard, Premium, PremiumV2, PremiumV3, Isolated, IsolatedV2)</li> </ul> <p>The pricing tier of an App Service plan determines what App Service features you get and how much you pay for the plan. The pricing tiers available to your App Service plan depend on the operating system selected at creation time. There are a few categories of pricing tiers:</p> <ul> <li>Shared compute: Free and Shared, the two base tiers, runs an app on the same Azure VM as other App Service apps, including apps of other customers. These tiers allocate CPU quotas to each app that runs on the shared resources, and the resources cannot scale out.</li> <li>Dedicated compute: The Basic, Standard, Premium, PremiumV2, and PremiumV3 tiers run apps on dedicated Azure VMs. Only apps in the same App Service plan share the same compute resources. The higher the tier, the more VM instances are available to you for scale-out.</li> <li>Isolated: This Isolated and IsolatedV2 tiers run dedicated Azure VMs on dedicated Azure Virtual Networks. It provides network isolation on top of compute isolation to your apps. It provides the maximum scale-out capabilities.</li> </ul> <p>App Service Environment networking</p> <p>App Service Environment is a single-tenant deployment of Azure App Service that hosts Windows and Linux containers, web apps, API apps, logic apps, and function apps. When you install an App Service Environment, you pick the Azure virtual network that you want it to be deployed in. All of the inbound and outbound application traffic is inside the virtual network you specify. You deploy into a single subnet in your virtual network, and nothing else can be deployed into that subnet.</p> <p>Subnet requirements</p> <p>You must delegate the subnet to Microsoft.Web/hostingEnvironments, and the subnet must be empty.</p> <p>The size of the subnet can affect the scaling limits of the App Service plan instances within the App Service Environment. It's a good idea to use a /24 address space (256 addresses) for your subnet to ensure enough addresses to support production scale.</p> <pre><code>Note\n\nWindows Containers uses an additional IP address per app for each App Service plan instance, and you need to size the subnet accordingly. If your App Service Environment has, for example, 2 Windows Container App Service plans, each with 25 instances and each with 5 apps running, you will need 300 IP addresses and additional addresses to support horizontal (up/down) scale.\n</code></pre> <p>If you use a smaller subnet, be aware of the following limitations:</p> <ul> <li>Any particular subnet has five addresses reserved for management purposes. In addition to the management addresses, App Service Environment dynamically scales the supporting infrastructure and uses between 4 and 27 addresses, depending on the configuration and load. You can use the remaining addresses for instances in the App Service plan. The minimal size of your subnet is a /27 address space (32 addresses).</li> <li>If you run out of addresses within your subnet, you can be restricted from scaling out your App Service plans in the App Service Environment. Another possibility is that you can experience increased latency during intensive traffic load if Microsoft can't scale the supporting infrastructure.</li> </ul> <p>Addresses</p> <p>App Service Environment has the following network information at creation:</p> Address   type Description App Service Environment virtual network The virtual network deployed into. App Service Environment subnet The subnet deployed into. Domain suffix The domain suffix that is used by the apps made. Virtual IP (VIP) The VIP type is used. The two possible values are internal and external. Inbound address The inbound address is the address at which your apps are reached. If you   have an internal VIP, it's an address in your App Service Environment subnet.   If the address is external, it's a public-facing address. Default outbound addresses The apps use this address, by   default, when making outbound calls to the internet. <p></p> <p>As you scale your App Service plans in your App Service Environment, you'll use more addresses from your subnet. The number of addresses you use varies based on the number of App Service plan instances you have and how much traffic there is. Apps in the App Service Environment don't have dedicated addresses in the subnet. The specific addresses an app uses in the subnet will change over time.</p> <p>Availability Zone Support for App Service Environments</p> <p>Azure App Service Environment can be deployed across availability zones (AZ) to help you achieve resiliency and reliability for your business-critical workloads. This architecture is also known as zone redundancy.</p> <p></p> <p>When you configure it to be zone redundant, the platform automatically spreads the instances of the Azure App Service plan across three zones in the selected region. This means that the minimum App Service Plan instance count will always be three. If you specify a capacity larger than three, and the number of instances is divisible by three, the instances are spread evenly. Otherwise, instance counts beyond 3*N are spread across the remaining one or two zones.</p> <p>Prerequisites</p> <ul> <li>You configure availability zones when you create your App Service Environment.<ul> <li>All App Service plans created in that App Service Environment will need a minimum of 3 instances, and those will automatically be zone redundant.</li> </ul> </li> <li>You can only specify availability zones when creating a new App Service Environment. A pre-existing App Service Environment can't be converted to use availability zones.</li> <li>Availability zones are only supported in a subset of regions.</li> </ul> <p>Downtime requirements</p> <p>Downtime will be dependent on how you decide to carry out the migration. Since you can't convert pre-existing App Service Environments to use availability zones, migration will consist of a side-by-side deployment where you'll create a new App Service Environment with availability zones enabled.</p> <p>Downtime will depend on how you choose to redirect traffic from your old to your new availability zone-enabled App Service Environment. For example, if you're using an Application Gateway, a custom domain, or Azure Front Door, downtime will be dependent on the time it takes to update those respective services with your new app's information. Alternatively, you can route traffic to multiple apps at the same time using a service such as Azure Traffic Manager and only fully cutover to your new availability zone-enabled apps when everything is deployed and fully tested. For more information on App Service Environment migration options, see App Service Environment migration. If you're already using App Service Environment v3, disregard the information about migration from previous versions and focus on the app migration strategies.</p> <p>App Service Environment Certificates</p> <p>Azure App Service provides a highly scalable, self-patching web hosting service. Once the certificate is added to your App Service app or function app, you can secure a custom Domain Name System (DNS) name with it or use it in your application code.</p> <pre><code>Note\n\nA certificate uploaded into an app is stored in a deployment unit that is bound to the app service plan's resource group and region combination (internally called a webspace). This makes the certificate accessible to other apps in the same resource group and region combination.\n</code></pre> <p>The following lists are options for adding certificates in App Service:</p> <ul> <li>Create a free App Service managed certificate: A private certificate that's free of charge and easy to use if you just need to secure your custom domain in App Service.</li> <li>Purchase an App Service certificate: A private certificate that's managed by Azure. It combines the simplicity of automated certificate management and the flexibility of renewal and export options.</li> <li>Import a certificate from Key Vault: Useful if you use Azure Key Vault to manage your Public-Key Cryptography Standards #12 (PKCS12) certificates.</li> <li>Upload a private certificate: If you already have a private certificate from a third-party provider, you can upload it.</li> <li>Upload a public certificate: Public certificates are not used to secure custom domains, but you can load them into your code if you need them to access remote resources.</li> </ul> <p>Prerequisites</p> <ul> <li>Create an App Service app.</li> <li>For a private certificate, make sure that it satisfies all requirements from App Service.</li> <li>Free certificate only:<ul> <li>Map the domain you want a certificate for to App Service.</li> <li>For a root domain (like contoso.com), make sure your app doesn't have any IP restrictions configured.

That data needs to be protected at rest, in transit, and while it's being used within an application. Azure provides a set of security features to protect your data, no matter where it's located.</p> <p>Scenario</p> <p>A security engineer will protect data within databases, file shares, or anywhere it resides, you'll work on such tasks as:</p> <ul> <li>Lock down access to storage to specific users and applications.</li> <li>Encrypt data where it's stored and while it's moved around.</li> <li>Use identity to protect data when it's accessed and used.</li> </ul> <p>Define data sovereignty</p> <p>What is Data Sovereignty? - Data sovereignty is the concept that information, which has been converted and stored in binary digital form, is subject to the laws of the country or region in which it is located. Many of the current concerns that surround data sovereignty relate to enforcing privacy regulations and preventing data stored in a foreign country or region from being subpoenaed by the host country or region\u2019s government.</p> <p>In Azure, customer data might be replicated within a selected geographic area for enhanced data durability during a major data center disaster, and in some cases will not be replicated outside it.</p> <p>Paired regions</p> <p>Azure operates in multiple geographies around the world. An Azure geography is a defined area of the world that contains at least one Azure Region. An Azure region is an area within a geography, containing one or more datacenters.</p> <p>Each Azure region is paired with another region within the same geography, forming a regional pair. The exception is Brazil South, which is paired with a region outside its geography. Across the region pairs Azure serializes platform updates (or planned maintenance), so that only one paired region is updated at a time. If an outage affecting multiple regions, one region in each pair will be prioritized for recovery.</p> <p></p> <p>We recommend that you configure business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) across regional pairs to benefit from Azure\u2019s isolation and VM policies. For applications that support multiple active regions, we recommend using both regions in a region pair where possible. Multiple regions will ensure optimal availability for applications and minimized recovery time in a disaster.</p> <p>Benefits of Azure paired regions</p> <ul> <li>Physical isolation - When possible, Azure services prefer at least 300 miles of separation between datacenters in a regional pair (although longer distance isn't practical or possible in all geographies). Physical datacenter separation reduces the likelihood of both regions being affected simultaneously as a result of natural disasters, civil unrest, power outages, or physical network outages. Isolation is subject to the constraints within the geography, such as geography size, power and network infrastructure availability, and regulations.</li> <li>Platform-provided replication - Some services such as geo-redundant storage provide automatic replication to the paired region.</li> <li>Region recovery order - If a broad outage occurs, recovery of one region is prioritized out of every pair. Applications that are deployed across paired regions are guaranteed to have one of the regions recovered with priority. If an application is deployed across regions that are not paired, recovery might be delayed. In the worst case, the chosen regions might be the last two to be recovered.</li> <li>Sequential updates - Planned Azure system updates are rolled out to paired regions sequentially, not at the same time. A staged roll-out helps minimize downtime, the effect of bugs, and logical failures in the rare event of a bad update.</li> <li>Data residency - To meet data residency requirements for tax and law enforcement jurisdiction purposes, a region resides within the same geography as its pair (except for Brazil South).</li> </ul> <p>Configure Azure storage access</p> <p>Every request made against a secured resource in the Blob, File, Queue, or Table service must be authorized. Authorization ensures that resources in your storage account are accessible only when you want them to be, and only to those users or applications to whom you grant access.</p> <p>Options for authorizing requests to Azure Storage include</p> <ul> <li>Azure AD - Azure Storage provides integration with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for identity-based authorization of requests to the Blob and Queue services. With Azure AD, you can use role-based access control (RBAC) to grant access to blob and queue resources to users, groups, or applications. You can grant permissions that are scoped to the level of an individual container or queue. Authorizing access to blob and queue data with Azure AD provides superior security and ease of use over other authorization options. When you use Azure AD to authorize requests make from your applications, you avoid having to store your account access key with your code, as you do with Shared Key authorization. While you can continue to use Shared Key authorization with your blob and queue applications, Microsoft recommends moving to Azure AD where possible.</li> <li>Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure AD DS) authorization for Azure Files. Azure Files supports identity-based authorization over Server Message Block (SMB) through Azure AD DS. You can use RBAC for fine-grained control over a client's access to Azure Files resources in a storage account</li> <li>Shared Key - Shared Key authorization relies on your account access keys and other parameters to produce an encrypted signature string that is passed on via the request in the Authorization header.</li> <li>Shared Access Signatures - A shared access signature (SAS) is a URI that grants restricted access rights to Azure Storage resources. You can provide a shared access signature to clients who should not be trusted with your storage account key but to whom you wish to delegate access to certain storage account resources. By distributing a shared access signature URI to these clients, you can grant them access to a resource for a specified period of time, with a specified set of permissions. The URI query parameters comprising the SAS token incorporate all of the information necessary to grant controlled access to a storage resource. A client who is in possession of the SAS can make a request against Azure Storage with just the SAS URI, and the information contained in the SAS token is used to authorize the request.</li> <li>Anonymous access to containers and blobs - You can enable anonymous, public read access to a container and its blobs in Azure Blob storage. By doing so, you can grant read-only access to these resources without sharing your account key, and without requiring a shared access signature (SAS).Public read access is best for scenarios where you want certain blobs to always be available for anonymous read access. For more fine-grained control, look to using the shared access signature, described above.</li> </ul> <p>Authenticating and authorizing access to blob and queue data with Azure AD provides superior security and ease of use over other authorization options. For example, by using Azure AD, you avoid having to store your account access key with your code, as you do with Shared Key authorization. While you can continue to use Shared Key authorization with your blob and queue applications, Microsoft recommends moving to Azure AD where possible.</p> <p>Similarly, you can continue to use shared access signatures (SAS) to grant fine-grained access to resources in your storage account, but Azure AD offers similar capabilities without the need to manage SAS tokens or worry about revoking a compromised SAS.</p> <pre><code>Important\n\nWhere possible use authorizing applications that access Azure Storage using Azure AD. It provides better security and ease of use over other authorization options.\n</code></pre> <p>Deploy shared access signatures</p> <p>As a best practice, you shouldn't share storage account keys with external third-party applications. If these apps need access to your data, you'll need to secure their connections without using storage account keys.</p> <p>For untrusted clients, use a shared access signature (SAS). A shared access signature is a string that contains a security token that can be attached to a URI. Use a shared access signature to delegate access to storage objects and specify constraints, such as the permissions and the time range of access.</p> <p>You can give a customer a shared access signature token, for example, so they can upload pictures to a file system in Blob storage. Separately, you can give a web application permission to read those pictures. In both cases, you allow only the access that the application needs to do the task.</p> <p>Types of shared access signatures</p> <ul> <li>You can use a service-level shared access signature to allow access to specific resources in a storage account. You'd use this type of shared access signature, for example, to allow an app to retrieve a list of files in a file system or to download a file.</li> <li>Use an account-level shared access signature to allow access to anything that a service-level shared access signature can allow, plus additional resources and abilities. For example, you can use an account-level shared access signature to allow the ability to create file systems.</li> <li>A user delegation SAS, introduced with version 2018-11-09. A user delegation SAS is secured with Azure AD credentials. This type of SAS is supported for the Blob service only and can be used to grant access to containers and blobs.</li> </ul> <p>Additionally, a service SAS can reference a stored access policy that provides an additional level of control over a set of signatures, including the ability to modify or revoke access to the resource if necessary.</p> <p>One would typically use a shared access signature for a service where users read and write their data to your storage account. Accounts that store user data have two typical designs:</p> <ul> <li>Clients upload and download data through a front-end proxy service, which performs authentication. This front-end proxy service has the advantage of allowing validation of business rules. But if the service must handle large amounts of data or high-volume transactions, you might find it complicated or expensive to scale this service to match demand.</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>A lightweight service authenticates the client as needed. Then it generates a shared access signature. After receiving the shared access signature, the client can access storage account resources directly. The shared access signature defines the client's permissions and access interval. The shared access signature reduces the need to route all data through the front-end proxy service.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Manage Azure AD storage authentication</p> <p>In addition to Shared Key and Shared Access Signatures, Azure Storage supports using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to authorize requests to blob data. With Azure AD, you can use Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) to grant permissions to a security principal, which may be a user, group, or application service principal. The security principal is authenticated by Azure AD to return an OAuth 2.0 token. The token can then be used to authorize a request against the Blob service.</p> <ul> <li>To authorize requests against Azure Storage with Azure AD provides superior security and ease of use over Shared Key authorization. Microsoft recommends using Azure AD authorization with your blob applications when possible to assure access with minimum required privileges.</li> <li>Authorization with Azure AD is available for all general-purpose and Blob storage accounts in all public regions and national clouds. Only storage accounts created with the Azure Resource Manager deployment model support Azure AD authorization.</li> <li>Blob storage additionally supports creating shared access signatures (SAS) that is signed with Azure AD credentials.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>A few more details</p> <p>When a security principal (a user, group, or application) attempts to access a queue resource, the request must be authorized. With Azure AD, access to a resource is a two-step process. First, the security principal's identity is authenticated, and an OAuth 2.0 token is returned. Next, the token is passed as part of a request to the Queue service and used by the service to authorize access to the specified resource.</p> <p>The authentication step requires that an application request an OAuth 2.0 access token at runtime. If an application is running from within an Azure entity, such as an Azure VM, a Virtual Machine Scale Set, or an Azure Functions app, it can use a managed identity to access queues.</p> <p>The authorization step requires one or more Azure roles to be assigned to the security principal. Azure Storage provides Azure roles that encompass common sets of permissions for queue data. The roles that are assigned to a security principal determine the permissions that that principal will have.</p> <p>Native and web applications that request the Azure Queue service can also authorize access with Azure AD.</p> <p>Implement storage service encryption</p> <p>Azure Storage security is a key part to defense in depth. Azure Storage provides a comprehensive set of security capabilities that together enable developers to build secure applications:</p> <ul> <li>All data (including metadata) written to Azure Storage is automatically encrypted using Storage Service Encryption (SSE).</li> <li>Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) are supported for Azure Storage for both resource management operations and data operations, as follows:<ul> <li>You can assign RBAC roles scoped to the storage account to security principals and use Azure AD to authorize resource management operations such as key management.</li> <li>Azure AD integration is supported for blob and queue data operations. You can assign RBAC roles scoped to a subscription, resource group, storage account, or an individual container or queue to a security principal or a managed identity for Azure resources.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Data can be secured in transit between an application and Azure by using Client-Side Encryption, HTTPS, or SMB 3.0.</li> <li>OS and data disks used by Azure virtual machines can be encrypted using Azure Disk Encryption.</li> <li>Delegated access to the data objects in Azure Storage can be granted using a shared access signature.</li> </ul> <p>Azure Storage encryption for data at rest</p> <p>Azure Storage automatically encrypts your data when persisting it to the cloud. Encryption protects your data and to help you to meet your organizational security and compliance commitments. Data in Azure Storage is encrypted and decrypted transparently using 256-bit AES encryption, one of the strongest block ciphers available, and is FIPS 140-2 compliant. Azure Storage encryption is similar to BitLocker encryption on Windows.</p> <p>Azure Storage encryption is enabled for all new and existing storage accounts and cannot be disabled. Because your data is secured by default, you don't need to modify your code or applications to take advantage of Azure Storage encryption.</p> <p>Storage accounts are encrypted regardless of their performance tier (standard or premium) or deployment model (Azure Resource Manager or classic). All Azure Storage redundancy options support encryption, and all copies of a storage account are encrypted. All Azure Storage resources are encrypted, including blobs, disks, files, queues, and tables. All object metadata is also encrypted.</p> <p>Encryption does not affect Azure Storage performance. There is no additional cost for Azure Storage encryption.</p> <p>Encryption key management</p> <p>You can rely on Microsoft-managed keys for the encryption of your storage account, or you can manage encryption with your own keys. If you choose to manage encryption with your own keys, you have two options:</p> <ul> <li>You can specify a customer-managed key to use for encrypting and decrypting all data in the storage account. A customer-managed key is used to encrypt all data in all services in your storage account.</li> <li>You can specify a customer-provided key on Blob storage operations. A client making a read or write request against Blob storage can include an encryption key on the request for granular control over how blob data is encrypted and decrypted.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>The following table compares key management options for Azure Storage encryption.</p> Microsoft-managed keys Customer-managed keys Customer-provided keys Encryption/decryption operations Azure Azure Azure Azure Storage services supported All Blob storage, Azure Files Blob storage Key storage Microsoft key store Azure Key Vault Azure Key Vault or any other key store Key rotation responsibility Microsoft Customer Customer Key usage Microsoft Azure portal, Storage Resource Provider REST API, Azure Storage management libraries, PowerShell, CLI Azure Storage REST API (Blob storage), Azure Storage client libraries Key access Microsoft only Microsoft, Customer Customer only <p>Configure blob data retention policies</p> <p>Immutable storage for Azure Blob storage enables users to store business-critical data objects in a WORM (Write Once, Read Many) state. This state makes the data non-erasable and non-modifiable for a user-specified interval. For the duration of the retention interval, blobs can be created and read, but cannot be modified or deleted. Immutable storage is available for general-purpose v2 and Blob storage accounts in all Azure regions.</p> <p>Time-based vs Legal hold policies</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Time-based retention policy support: Users can set policies to store data for a specified interval. When a time-based retention policy is set, blobs can be created and read, but not modified or deleted. After the retention period has expired, blobs can be deleted but not overwritten. When a time-based retention policy is applied on a container, all blobs in the container will stay in the immutable state for the duration of the effective retention period. The effective retention period for blobs is equal to the difference between the blob's creation time and the user-specified retention interval. Because users can extend the retention interval, immutable storage uses the most recent value of the user-specified retention interval to calculate the effective retention period.</li> <li>Legal hold policy support: If the retention interval is not known, users can set legal holds to store immutable data until the legal hold is cleared. When a legal hold policy is set, blobs can be created and read, but not modified or deleted. Each legal hold is associated with a user-defined alphanumeric tag (such as a case ID, event name, etc.) that is used as an identifier string. Legal holds are temporary holds that can be used for legal investigation purposes or general protection policies. Each legal hold policy needs to be associated with one or more tags. Tags are used as a named identifier, such as a case ID or event, to categorize and describe the purpose of the hold.</li> </ul> <p>Other immutable storage features</p> <ul> <li>Support for all blob tiers: WORM policies are independent of the Azure Blob storage tier and apply to all the tiers: hot, cool, and archive. Users can transition data to the most cost-optimized tier for their workloads while maintaining data immutability.</li> <li>Container-level configuration: Users can configure time-based retention policies and legal hold tags at the container level. By using simple container-level settings, users can create and lock time-based retention policies, extend retention intervals, set and clear legal holds, and more. These policies apply to all the blobs in the container, both existing and new.</li> <li>Audit logging support: Each container includes a policy audit log. It shows up to seven time-based retention commands for locked time-based retention policies and contains the user ID, command type, time stamps, and retention interval. For legal holds, the log contains the user ID, command type, time stamps, and legal hold tags. This log is retained for the lifetime of the policy, in accordance with the SEC 17a-4(f) regulatory guidelines. The Azure Activity Log shows a more comprehensive log of all the control plane activities; while enabling Azure Resource Logs retains and shows data plane operations. It is the user's responsibility to store those logs persistently, as might be required for regulatory or other purposes.</li> </ul> <pre><code>Important\n\nA container can have both a legal hold and a time-based retention policy at the same time. All blobs in that container stay in the immutable state until all legal holds are cleared, even if their effective retention period has expired. Conversely, a blob stays in an immutable state until the effective retention period expires, even though all legal holds have been cleared.\n</code></pre> <p>Configure Azure files authentication</p> <p>Azure Files supports identity-based authentication over Server Message Block (SMB) through on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure AD DS). This article focuses on how Azure file shares can use domain services, either on-premises or in Azure, to support identity-based access to Azure file shares over SMB. Enabling identity-based access for your Azure file shares allows you to replace existing file servers with Azure file shares without replacing your existing directory service, maintaining seamless user access to shares.</p> <p>Azure Files enforces authorization on user access to both the share and the directory/file levels. Share-level permission assignment can be performed on Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) users or groups managed through the role-based access control (RBAC) model. With RBAC, the credentials you use for file access should be available or synced to Azure AD. You can assign built-in RBAC roles like Storage File Data SMB Share Reader to users or groups in Azure AD to grant read access to an Azure file share.</p> <p>At the directory/file level, Azure Files supports preserving, inheriting, and enforcing Windows DACLs just like any Windows file servers. You can choose to keep Windows DACLs when copying data over SMB between your existing file share and your Azure file shares. Whether you plan to enforce authorization or not, you can use Azure file shares to back up ACLs along with your data.</p> <p>Advantages of identity-based authentication</p> <p>Identity-based authentication for Azure Files offers several benefits over using Shared Key authentication:</p> <ul> <li>Extend the traditional identity-based file share access experience to the cloud with on-premises AD DS and Azure AD DS. If you plan to lift and shift your application to the cloud, replacing traditional file servers with Azure file shares, then you may want your application to authenticate with either on-premises AD DS or Azure AD DS credentials to access file data. Azure Files supports using both on-premises AD DS or Azure AD DS credentials to access Azure file shares over SMB from either on-premises AD DS or Azure AD DS domain-joined VMs.</li> <li>Enforce granular access control on Azure file shares. You can grant permissions to a specific identity at the share, directory, or file level. For example, suppose that you have several teams using a single Azure file share for project collaboration. You can grant all teams access to non-sensitive directories while limiting access to directories containing sensitive financial data to your Finance team only.</li> <li>Back up Windows ACLs (also known as NTFS) along with your data. You can use Azure file shares to back up your existing on-premises file shares. Azure Files preserves your ACLs along with your data when you back up a file share to Azure file shares over SMB.</li> </ul> <p>Identity-based authentication data flow</p> <p></p> <p>How it works</p> <p>Azure file shares leverages Kerberos protocol for authenticating with either on-premises AD DS or Azure AD DS. When an identity associated with a user or application running on a client attempts to access data in Azure file shares, the request is sent to the domain service, either AD DS or Azure AD DS, to authenticate the identity. If authentication is successful, it returns a Kerberos token. The client sends a request that includes the Kerberos token and Azure file shares use that token to authorize the request. Azure file shares only receive the Kerberos token, not access credentials.</p> <p>Preserve directory and file ACLs when importing data to Azure file shares</p> <p>Azure Files supports preserving directory or file level ACLs when copying data to Azure file shares. You can copy ACLs on a directory or file to Azure file shares using either Azure File Sync or common file movement toolsets. For example, you can use robocopy with the /copy:s flag to copy data as well as ACLs to an Azure file share. ACLs are preserved by default, you are not required to enable identity-based authentication on your storage account to preserve ACLs.</p> <p>Enable the secure transfer required property</p> <p>You can configure your storage account to accept requests from secure connections only by setting the Secure transfer required property for the storage account. When you require secure transfer, any requests originating from an insecure connection are rejected. Microsoft recommends that you always require secure transfer for all of your storage accounts.</p> <p>When secure transfer is required, a call to an Azure Storage REST API operation must be made over HTTPS. Any request made over HTTP is rejected.</p> <p>Connecting to an Azure File share over SMB without encryption fails when secure transfer is required for the storage account. Examples of insecure connections include those made over SMB 2.1, SMB 3.0 without encryption, or some versions of the Linux SMB client.</p> <p>By default, the Secure transfer required property is enabled when you create a storage account. Azure Storage doesn't support HTTPS for custom domain names, this option is not applied when you're using a custom domain name.</p> <p>Require secure transfer for a new storage account</p> <p></p> <pre><code> Important\n\nAzure Files connections require encryption (SMB)\n</code></pre> <p>Perform Try-This exercises</p> <p>Use this Try-This exercise to gain some hands-on experience with Azure.</p> <p>In this demonstration, we'll explore storage security configurations.</p> <p>Task 1: Generate SAS tokens</p> <pre><code>Note\n\nThis demonstration requires a storage account with a blob container and an uploaded file.

To help protect your data, firewalls prevent all access to your database server until you specify which computers have permission. The firewall grants access to databases based on the originating IP address of each request.</p> <p>In addition to IP rules, the firewall also manages virtual network rules. Virtual network rules are based on virtual network service endpoints. Virtual network rules might be preferable to IP rules in some cases.</p> <p>Overview</p> <p>Initially, all access to your Azure SQL Database is blocked by the SQL Database firewall. To access a database server, you must specify one or more server-level IP firewall rules that enable access to your Azure SQL Database. Use the IP firewall rules to specify which IP address ranges from the internet are allowed, and whether Azure applications can attempt to connect to your Azure SQL Database.</p> <p>To selectively grant access to just one of the databases in your Azure SQL Database, you must create a database-level rule for the required database. Specify an IP address range for the database IP firewall rule that is beyond the IP address range specified in the server-level IP firewall rule, and ensure that the IP address of the client falls in the range specified in the database-level rule.</p> <pre><code>Note\n\nAzure Synapse Analytics only supports server-level IP firewall rules, and not database-level IP firewall rules.\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>Connecting from the internet</p> <p>When a computer attempts to connect to your database server from the internet, the firewall first checks the originating IP address of the request against the database-level IP firewall rules for the database that the connection is requesting:</p> <ul> <li>If the IP address of the request is within one of the ranges specified in the database-level IP firewall rules, the connection is granted to the SQL Database containing the rule.</li> <li>If the IP address of the request is not within one of the ranges specified in the database-level IP firewall rules, the firewall checks the server-level IP firewall rules. If the IP address of the request is within one of the ranges specified in the server-level IP firewall rules, the connection is granted. Server-level IP firewall rules apply to all SQL databases on the Azure SQL Database.</li> <li>If the IP address of the request is not within the ranges specified in any of the database-level or server-level IP firewall rules, the connection request fails.</li> </ul> <p>Connecting from Azure</p> <p>To allow applications from Azure to connect to your Azure SQL Database, Azure connections must be enabled. When an application from Azure attempts to connect to your database server, the firewall verifies that Azure connections are allowed. A firewall setting with starting and ending addresses equal to 0.0.0.0 indicates Azure connections are allowed. If the connection attempt is not allowed, the request does not reach the Azure SQL Database server.</p> <p>This option configures the firewall to allow all connections from Azure including connections from the subscriptions of other customers. When selecting this option, make sure your sign-in and user permissions limit access to authorized users only.</p> <p>Server-level IP firewall rules</p> <p>Server-level IP firewall rules enable clients to access your entire Azure SQL Database\u2014that is, all the databases within the same SQL Database server. These rules are stored in the master database.</p> <p>You can configure server-level IP firewall rules using the Azure portal, PowerShell, or by using Transact-SQL statements. To create server-level IP firewall rules using the Azure portal or PowerShell, you must be the subscription owner or a subscription contributor. To create a server-level IP firewall rule using Transact-SQL, you must connect to the SQL Database instance as the server-level principal login or the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) administrator (which means that a server-level IP firewall rule must have first been created by a user with Azure-level permissions).</p> <p>Database-level IP firewall rules</p> <p>Database-level IP firewall rules enable clients to access certain secure databases within the same SQL Database server. You can create these rules for each database (including the master database), and they are stored in the individual databases. You can only create and manage database-level IP firewall rules for master databases and user databases by using Transact-SQL statements, and only after you have configured the first server-level firewall. If you specify an IP address range in the database-level IP firewall rule that is outside the range specified in the server-level IP firewall rule, only those clients that have IP addresses in the database-level range can access the database. You can have a maximum of 128 database-level IP firewall rules for a database.</p> <pre><code>Important\n\nWhenever possible, as a best practice, use database-level IP firewall rules to enhance security and to make your database more portable. Use server-level IP firewall rules for administrators and when you have several databases with the same access requirements, and you don't want to spend time configuring each database individually.\n</code></pre> <p>Enable and monitor database auditing</p> <p>Auditing for Azure SQL Database and Azure Synapse Analytics tracks database events and writes them to an audit log in your Azure storage account, Log Analytics workspace or Event Hubs.</p> <p>Auditing also:</p> <ul> <li>Helps you maintain regulatory compliance, understand database activity, and gain insight into discrepancies and anomalies that could indicate business concerns or suspected security violations.</li> <li>Enables and facilitates adherence to compliance standards, although it doesn't guarantee compliance.</li> </ul> <p>Overview</p> <p>You can use SQL database auditing to:</p> <ul> <li>Retain an audit trail of selected events. You can define categories of database actions to be audited.</li> <li>Report on database activity. You can use pre-configured reports and a dashboard to get started quickly with activity and event reporting.</li> <li>Analyze reports. You can find suspicious events, unusual activity, and trends.</li> </ul> <p>Define server-level vs. database-level auditing policy</p> <p>An auditing policy can be defined for a specific database or as a default server policy:</p> <ul> <li>A server policy applies to all existing and newly created databases on the server.</li> <li>If server auditing is enabled, it always applies to the database. The database will be audited, regardless of the database auditing settings.</li> <li>Enabling auditing on the database or data warehouse, in addition to enabling it on the server, does not override or change any of the settings of the server auditing. Both audits will exist side by side. In other words, the database is audited twice in parallel; once by the server policy and once by the database policy.</li> </ul> <p>Shown below is the configuration of auditing using the Azure portal.</p> <p></p> <p>Summary of database auditing</p> <ul> <li>Retain an audit trail of selected events</li> <li>Report on database activity and analyze results</li> <li>Configure policies for the server or database level</li> <li>Configure audit log destination</li> <li>A new server policy applies to all existing and newly created databases</li> </ul> <p>Implement data discovery and classification</p> <p>Data Discovery &amp; Classification is built into Azure SQL Database. It provides advanced capabilities for discovering, classifying, labeling, and reporting the sensitive data in your databases.</p> <p>Your most sensitive data might include business, financial, healthcare, or personal information. Discovering and classifying this data can play a pivotal role in your organization's information-protection approach. It can serve as infrastructure for:</p> <ul> <li>Helping to meet standards for data privacy and requirements for regulatory compliance.</li> <li>Various security scenarios, such as monitoring (auditing) and alerting on anomalous access to sensitive data.</li> <li>Controlling access to and hardening the security of databases that contain highly sensitive data.</li> </ul> <p>Data Discovery &amp; Classification is part of the Advanced Data Security offering, which is a unified package for advanced SQL security capabilities. You can access and manage Data Discovery &amp; Classification via the central SQL Advanced Data Security section of the Azure portal.</p> <p></p> <p>Classifying your data and identifying your data protection needs helps you select the right cloud solution for your organization. Data classification enables organizations to find storage optimizations that might not be possible when all data is assigned the same value. Classifying (or categorizing) stored data by sensitivity and business impact helps organizations determine the risks associated with the data. After your data has been classified, organizations can manage their data in ways that reflect their internal value instead of treating all data the same way.</p> <p>Data classification can yield benefits such as compliance efficiencies, improved ways to manage the organization\u2019s resources, and facilitation of migration to the cloud. Some data protection solutions\u2014such as encryption, rights management, and data loss prevention\u2014have moved to the cloud and can help mitigate cloud risks. However, organization must be sure to address data classification rules for data retention when moving to the cloud.</p> <p>Data exists in one of three basic states: at rest, in process, and in transit. All three states require unique technical solutions for data classification, but the applied principles of data classification should be the same for each. Data that is classified as confidential needs to stay confidential when at rest, in process, or in transit.</p> <p>Data can also be either structured or unstructured. Typical classification processes for structured data found in databases and spreadsheets are less complex and time-consuming to manage than those for unstructured data such as documents, source code, and email. Generally, organizations will have more unstructured data than structured data.</p> <p>Regardless of whether data is structured or unstructured, it\u2019s important for organizations to manage data sensitivity. When properly implemented, data classification helps ensure that sensitive or confidential data assets are managed with greater oversight than data assets that are considered public distribution.</p> <p>Protect data at rest</p> <p>Data encryption at rest is a mandatory step toward data privacy, compliance, and data sovereignty.</p> Best practice Solution Apply disk encryption to help safeguard your data. Use Microsoft Azure Disk Encryption, which enables IT administrators to encrypt both Windows infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and Linux IaaS virtual machine (VM) disks. Disk encryption combines the industry-standard BitLocker feature and the Linux DM-Crypt feature to provide volume encryption for the operating system (OS) and the data disks. Azure Storage and Azure SQL Database encrypt data at rest by default, and many services offer encryption as an option. You can use Azure Key Vault to maintain control of keys that access and encrypt your data. Use encryption to help mitigate risks related to unauthorized data access. Encrypt your drives before you write sensitive data to them. Organizations that don\u2019t enforce data encryption are risk greater exposure to data-integrity issues. For example, unauthorized users or malicious hackers might steal data in compromised accounts or gain unauthorized access to data coded in Clear Format. To comply with industry regulations, companies also must prove that they are diligent and using correct security controls to enhance their data security. <p>Protect data in transit</p> <p>Protecting data in transit should be an essential part of your data protection strategy. Because data is moving back and forth from many locations, we generally recommend that you always use SSL/TLS protocols to exchange data across different locations. In some circumstances, you might want to isolate the entire communication channel between your on-premises and cloud infrastructures by using a VPN.</p> <p>For data moving between your on-premises infrastructure and Azure, consider appropriate safeguards such as HTTPS or VPN. When sending encrypted traffic between an Azure virtual network and an on-premises location over the public internet, use Azure VPN Gateway.</p> <p>The following table lists best practices specific to using Azure VPN Gateway, SSL/TLS, and HTTPS.</p> Best practice Solution Secure access from multiple workstations located on-premises to an Azure virtual network Use site-to-site VPN. Secure access from an individual workstation located on-premises to an Azure virtual network Use point-to-site VPN. Move larger data sets over a dedicated high-speed wide area network (WAN) link Use Azure ExpressRoute. If you choose to use ExpressRoute, you can also encrypt the data at the application level by using SSL/TLS or other protocols for added protection. Interact with Azure Storage through the Azure portal All transactions occur via HTTPS. You can also use Storage REST API over HTTPS to interact with Azure Storage and Azure SQL Database. <p>Organizations that fail to protect data in transit are more susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks, eavesdropping, and session hijacking. These attacks can be the first step in gaining access to confidential data.</p> <p>Now that we\u2019ve covered the physical aspects of data classification, let\u2019s look at the classification based on discovery and classification.</p> <p>Data Discovery</p> <p>Data discovery and classification provides advanced capabilities built into Azure SQL Database for discovering, classifying, labeling and protecting sensitive data (such as business, personal data, and financial information) in your databases. Discovering and classifying this data can play a pivotal role in your organizational information protection stature. It can serve as infrastructure for:</p> <ul> <li>Helping meet data privacy standards and regulatory compliance requirements.</li> <li>Addressing various security scenarios such as monitoring, auditing, and alerting on anomalous access to sensitive data.</li> <li>Controlling access to and hardening the security of databases containing highly sensitive data.</li> </ul> <p>Data discovery and classification is part of the Advanced Data Security offering, which is a unified package for advanced Microsoft SQL Server security capabilities. You access and manage data discovery and classification via the central SQL Advanced Data Security portal.</p> <p>Data discovery and classification introduces a set of advanced services and SQL capabilities, forming a SQL Information Protection paradigm aimed at protecting the data, not just the database:</p> <ul> <li>Discovery and recommendations - The classification engine scans your database and identifies columns containing potentially sensitive data. It then provides you with an easier way to review and apply the appropriate classification recommendations via the Azure portal.</li> <li>Labeling - Sensitivity classification labels can be persistently tagged on columns using new classification metadata attributes introduced into the SQL Server Engine. This metadata can then be utilized for advanced sensitivity-based auditing and protection scenarios.</li> <li>Query result set sensitivity - The sensitivity of the query result set is calculated in real time for auditing purposes.</li> <li>Visibility - You can view the database classification state in a detailed dashboard in the Azure portal. Additionally, you can download a report (in Microsoft Excel format) that you can use for compliance and auditing purposes, in addition to other needs.</li> </ul> <p>Steps for discovery, classification, and labeling</p> <p>Classifications have two metadata attributes:</p> <ul> <li>Labels - These are the main classification attributes used to define the sensitivity level of the data stored in the column.</li> <li>Information Types - These provide additional granularity into the type of data stored in the column.</li> </ul> <p>SQL data discovery and classification comes with a built-in set of sensitivity labels and information types, and discovery logic. You can now customize this taxonomy and define a set and ranking of classification constructs specifically for your environment.</p> <p>Definition and customization of your classification taxonomy takes place in one central location for your entire Azure Tenant. That location is in Microsoft Defender for Cloud, as part of your Security Policy. Only a user with administrative rights on the Tenant root management group can perform this task.</p> <p>As part of Azure Information Protection policy management, you can define custom labels, rank them, and associate them with a selected set of information types. You can also add your own custom information types and configure them with string patterns, which are added to the discovery logic for identifying this type of data in your databases. Learn more about customizing and managing your policy in the Information Protection policy how-to guide.</p> <p>After you\u2019ve defined the tenant-wide policy, you can continue with classifying individual databases using your customized policy.</p> <p>Microsoft Defender for SQL</p> <p>Applies to: Azure SQL Database | Azure SQL Managed Instance | Azure Synapse Analytics</p> <p>Microsoft Defender for SQL is a Defender plan in Microsoft Defender for Cloud. Microsoft Defender for SQL includes functionality for surfacing and mitigating potential database vulnerabilities and detecting anomalous activities that could indicate a threat to your database. It provides a single go-to location for enabling and managing these capabilities.</p> <p>What are the benefits of Microsoft Defender for SQL?</p> <p>Microsoft Defender for SQL provides a set of advanced SQL security capabilities, including SQL Vulnerability Assessment and Advanced Threat Protection.</p> <ul> <li>Vulnerability Assessment is an easy-to-configure service that can discover, track, and help you remediate potential database vulnerabilities. It provides visibility into your security state, and it includes actionable steps to resolve security issues and enhance your database fortifications.</li> <li>Advanced Threat Protection detects anomalous activities indicating unusual and potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit your database.

With one selection, you can enable Microsoft Defender for all databases on your server in Azure or in your SQL Managed Instance. Enabling or managing Microsoft Defender for SQL settings requires belonging to the SQL security manager role or one of the database or server admin roles.</p> <p>Example: Database selection options 4/4</p> <p></p> <p>Vulnerability assessment for SQL Server</p> <p>What is SQL vulnerability assessment? SQL vulnerability assessment is a service that provides visibility into your security state. Vulnerability assessment includes actionable steps to resolve security issues and enhance your database security. It can help you to monitor a dynamic database environment where changes are difficult to track and improve your SQL security posture.</p> <p>Vulnerability assessment is a scanning service built into Azure SQL Database. The service employs a knowledge base of rules that flag security vulnerabilities. It highlights deviations from best practices, such as misconfigurations, excessive permissions, and unprotected sensitive data.</p> <p>The rules are based on Microsoft's best practices and focus on the security issues that present the biggest risks to your database and its valuable data. They cover database-level issues and server-level security issues, like server firewall settings and server-level permissions.</p> <p>The results of the scan include actionable steps to resolve each issue and provide customized remediation scripts where applicable. You can customize an assessment report for your environment by setting an acceptable baseline for:</p> <ul> <li>Permission configurations</li> <li>Feature configurations</li> <li>Database settings</li> </ul> <p>SQL vulnerability assessment is an easy-to-configure service that can discover, track, and help you remediate potential database vulnerabilities. Use it to proactively improve your database security for:</p> <ul> <li>Azure SQL Database</li> <li>Azure SQL Managed Instance</li> <li>Azure Synapse Analytics</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Vulnerability assessment is part of Microsoft Defender for Azure SQL, which is a unified package for advanced SQL security capabilities. Vulnerability assessment can be accessed and managed from each SQL database resource in the Azure portal.</p> <p>SQL Advanced Threat Protection</p> <p>Advanced Threat Protection for Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, Azure Synapse Analytics, SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines and Azure Arc-enabled SQL Server detects anomalous activities indicating unusual and potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit databases.</p> <p>Advanced Threat Protection is part of the Microsoft Defender for SQL offering, which is a unified package for advanced SQL security capabilities. Advanced Threat Protection can be accessed and managed via the central Microsoft Defender for SQL portal.</p> <p>Overview</p> <p>Advanced Threat Protection provides a new layer of security, which enables customers to detect and respond to potential threats as they occur by providing security alerts on anomalous activities. Users receive an alert upon suspicious database activities, potential vulnerabilities, and SQL injection attacks, as well as anomalous database access and queries patterns. Advanced Threat Protection integrates alerts with Microsoft Defender for Cloud, which include details of suspicious activity and recommend action on how to investigate and mitigate the threat. Advanced Threat Protection makes it simple to address potential threats to the database without the need to be a security expert or manage advanced security monitoring systems.</p> <p>For a full investigation experience, it is recommended to enable auditing, which writes database events to an audit log in your Azure storage account.</p> <p></p> <p>Explore detection of a suspicious event</p> <p>You receive an email notification upon detection of anomalous database activities. The email provides information on the suspicious security event, including the nature of the anomalous activities, database name, server name, application name, and event time. In addition, the email provides information on possible causes and recommended actions to investigate and mitigate the potential threat to the database.</p> <p>Example: Email notification providing information on a suspicious security event.</p> <p></p> <p>Click the View recent SQL alerts link in the email to launch the Azure portal and show the Microsoft Defender for Cloud alerts page, which provides an overview of active threats detected on the database.</p> <p></p> <p>Click a specific alert to get additional details and actions for investigating this threat and remediating future threats.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, SQL injection is one of the most common Web application security issues on the Internet that is used to attack data-driven applications. Attackers take advantage of application vulnerabilities to inject malicious SQL statements into application entry fields, breaching or modifying data in the database. For SQL Injection alerts, the alert's details include the vulnerable SQL statement that was exploited.</p> <p></p> <p>Explore alerts in the Azure portal</p> <p>Advanced Threat Protection integrates its alerts with Microsoft Defender for Cloud. Live SQL Advanced Threat Protection tiles within the database and SQL Microsoft Defender for Cloud blades in the Azure portal track the status of active threats.</p> <p>Click the Advanced Threat Protection alert to launch the Microsoft Defender for Cloud alerts page and get an overview of active SQL threats detected on the database.</p> <p></p> <p>SQL vulnerability assessment express and classic configurations</p> <p>What are the SQL vulnerability assessments express and classic configurations?</p> <p>You can configure vulnerability assessment for your SQL databases with either:</p> <ul> <li>Express configuration (preview) \u2013 The default procedure that lets you configure vulnerability assessment without dependency on external storage to store baseline and scan result data.</li> <li>Classic configuration \u2013 The legacy procedure that requires you to manage an Azure storage account to store baseline and scan result data.</li> </ul> <p>Configuration modes benefits and limitations comparison:</p> <p></p> <p>Configure dynamic data masking</p> <p>SQL Database dynamic data masking (DDM) limits sensitive data exposure by masking it to non-privileged users.</p> <p>Dynamic data masking helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data by enabling customers to designate how much of the sensitive data to reveal with minimal impact on the application layer. It\u2019s a policy-based security feature that hides the sensitive data in the result set of a query over designated database fields, while the data in the database is not changed.</p> <p>For example, a service representative at a call center may identify callers by several digits of their credit card number, but those data items should not be fully exposed to the service representative. A masking rule can be defined that masks all but the last four digits of any credit card number in the result set of any query. As another example, an appropriate data mask can be defined to protect personal data, so that a developer can query production environments for troubleshooting purposes without violating compliance regulations.</p> <p>Dynamic data masking basics</p> <p>You set up a dynamic data masking policy in the Azure portal by selecting the dynamic data masking operation in your SQL Database configuration blade or settings blade. This feature cannot be set by using portal for Azure Synapse</p> <p>Dynamic data masking policy</p> <ul> <li>SQL users excluded from masking - A set of SQL users or Azure AD identities that get unmasked data in the SQL query results. Users with administrator privileges are always excluded from masking, and view the original data without any mask.</li> <li>Masking rules - A set of rules that define the designated fields to be masked and the masking function that is used. The designated fields can be defined using a database schema name, table name, and column name.</li> <li>Masking functions - A set of methods that control the exposure of data for different scenarios.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Recommended fields to mask</p> <p>The DDM recommendations engine, flags certain fields from your database as potentially sensitive fields, which may be good candidates for masking. In the Dynamic Data Masking blade in the portal, you can review the recommended columns for your database. All you need to do is click Add Mask for one or more columns and then Save to apply a mask for these fields.</p> <p>Implement transparent data encryption</p> <p>Transparent data encryption (TDE) helps protect Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, and Synapse SQL in Azure Synapse Analytics against the threat of malicious offline activity by encrypting data at rest. It performs real-time encryption and decryption of the database, associated backups, and transaction log files at rest without requiring changes to the application. By default, TDE is enabled for all newly deployed Azure SQL databases and needs to be manually enabled for older databases of Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, or Azure Synapse.</p> <p>TDE performs real-time I/O encryption and decryption of the data at the page level. Each page is decrypted when it's read into memory and then encrypted before being written to disk. TDE encrypts the storage of an entire database by using a symmetric key called the Database Encryption Key (DEK). On database startup, the encrypted DEK is decrypted and then used for decryption and re-encryption of the database files in the SQL Server Database Engine process. DEK is protected by the TDE protector. TDE protector is either a service-managed certificate (service-managed transparent data encryption) or an asymmetric key stored in Azure Key Vault (customer-managed transparent data encryption).</p> <p>For Azure SQL Database and Azure Synapse, the TDE protector is set at the logical SQL server level and is inherited by all databases associated with that server. For Azure SQL Managed Instance (BYOK feature in preview), the TDE protector is set at the instance level and it is inherited by all encrypted databases on that instance. The term server refers both to server and instance throughout this document, unless stated differently.</p> <p>Service-managed transparent data encryption</p> <p>In Azure, the default setting for TDE is that the DEK is protected by a built-in server certificate. The built-in server certificate is unique for each server and the encryption algorithm used is AES 256. If a database is in a geo-replication relationship, both the primary and geo-secondary databases are protected by the primary database's parent server key. If two databases are connected to the same server, they also share the same built-in certificate. Microsoft automatically rotates these certificates in compliance with the internal security policy and the root key is protected by a Microsoft internal secret store. Customers can verify SQL Database compliance with internal security policies in independent third-party audit reports available on the Microsoft Trust Center.</p> <p>Microsoft also seamlessly moves and manages the keys as needed for geo-replication and restores.</p> <p>Customer-managed transparent data encryption - Bring Your Own Key</p> <p>Customer-managed TDE is also referred to as Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) support for TDE. In this scenario, the TDE Protector that encrypts the DEK is a customer-managed asymmetric key, which is stored in a customer-owned and managed Azure Key Vault (Azure's cloud-based external key management system) and never leaves the key vault. The TDE Protector can be generated by the key vault or transferred to the key vault from an on premises hardware security module (HSM) device. SQL Database needs to be granted permissions to the customer-owned key vault to decrypt and encrypt the DEK. If permissions of the logical SQL server to the key vault are revoked, a database will be inaccessible, and all data is encrypted</p> <p>With TDE with Azure Key Vault integration, users can control key management tasks including key rotations, key vault permissions, key backups, and enable auditing/reporting on all TDE protectors using Azure Key Vault functionality. Key Vault provides central key management, leverages tightly monitored HSMs, and enables separation of duties between management of keys and data to help meet compliance with security policies.</p> <p></p> <p>Manage TDE in the Azure portal</p> <p>To configure TDE through the Azure portal, you must be connected as the Azure Owner, Contributor, or SQL Security Manager.</p> <p>You turn TDE on and off on the database level. To enable TDE on a database, go to the Azure portal and sign in with your Azure Administrator or Contributor account. Find the TDE settings under your user database. By default, service-managed transparent data encryption is used. A TDE certificate is automatically generated for the server that contains the database. For Azure SQL Managed Instance use T-SQL to turn TDE on and off on a database.</p> <p>Deploy always encrypted features</p> <p>Ensure that your database is always encrypted.</p> <p>SQL Database Always Encrypted</p> <p>Always Encrypted is a feature designed to protect sensitive data, such as credit card numbers or national/regional identification numbers (for example, U.S. social security numbers), stored in Azure SQL Database or SQL Server databases. Always Encrypted allows clients to encrypt sensitive data inside client applications and never reveal the encryption keys to the Database Engine (SQL Database or SQL Server). As a result, Always Encrypted provides a separation between users who own the data (and can view it) and users who manage the data (but should have no access). By ensuring on-premises database administrators, cloud database operators, or other high-privileged, but unauthorized users, cannot access the encrypted data. Always Encrypted enables customers to confidently store sensitive data outside of their direct control. So, Always Encrypted allows organizations to encrypt data at rest and in use for storage in Azure, to enable delegation of on-premises database administration to third parties, or to reduce security clearance requirements for their own DBA staff.</p> <p>Always Encrypted makes encryption transparent to applications. An Always Encrypted-enabled driver installed on the client computer achieves this by automatically encrypting and decrypting sensitive data in the client application. The driver encrypts the data in sensitive columns before passing the data to the Database Engine, and automatically rewrites queries so that the semantics to the application are preserved. Similarly, the driver transparently decrypts data, stored in encrypted database columns, contained in query results.</p> <p>Example usage scenarios</p> <p>Client On-Premises with Data in Azure</p> <p>A customer has an on-premises client application at their business location. The application operates on sensitive data stored in a database hosted in Azure (SQL Database or SQL Server running in a virtual machine on Microsoft Azure). The customer uses Always Encrypted and stores Always Encrypted keys in a trusted key store hosted on-premises, to ensure Microsoft cloud administrators have no access to sensitive data.</p> <p>Client and Data in Azure</p> <p>A customer has a client application, hosted in Microsoft Azure (for example, in a worker role or a web role), which operates on sensitive data stored in a database hosted in Azure (SQL Database or SQL Server running in a virtual machine on Microsoft Azure). Although Always Encrypted does not provide complete isolation of data from cloud administrators, as both the data and keys are exposed to cloud administrators of the platform hosting the client tier, the customer still benefits from reducing the security attack surface area (the data is always encrypted in the database).</p> <p></p> <p>Always Encrypted Features</p> <p>The Database Engine never operates on plaintext data stored in encrypted columns, but it still supports some queries on encrypted data, depending on the encryption type for the column. Always Encrypted supports two types of encryption: randomized encryption and deterministic encryption.</p> <ul> <li>Deterministic encryption always generates the same encrypted value for any given plain text value. Using deterministic encryption allows point lookups, equality joins, grouping and indexing on encrypted columns. However, it may also allow unauthorized users to guess information about encrypted values by examining patterns in the encrypted column, especially if there is a small set of possible encrypted values, such as True/False, or North/South/East/West region. Deterministic encryption must use a column collation with a binary2 sort order for character columns.</li> <li>Randomized encryption uses a method that encrypts data in a less predictable manner. Randomized encryption is more secure, but prevents searching, grouping, indexing, and joining on encrypted columns.</li> </ul> <p>Use deterministic encryption for columns that will be used as search or grouping parameters, for example a government ID number. Use randomized encryption, for data such as confidential investigation comments, which are not grouped with other records and are not used to join tables.</p> <p>Deploy an always encrypted implementation</p> <p>A proper always encrypting implementation is important to a secure database.</p> <p>Configuring Always Encrypted The initial setup of Always Encrypted in a database involves generating Always Encrypted keys, creating key metadata, configuring encryption properties of selected database columns, and/or encrypting data that may already exist in columns that need to be encrypted. Remember that some of these tasks aren't supported in Transact-SQL and require the use of client-side tools. As Always Encrypted keys and protected sensitive data are never revealed in plaintext to the server, the Database Engine can't be involved in key provisioning and perform data encryption or decryption operations. You can use SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or PowerShell to accomplish such tasks.</p> Task SSMS PowerShell SQL Provisioning column master keys, column encryption keys and encrypted column encryption keys with their corresponding column master keys Yes Yes No Creating key metadata in the database Yes Yes Yes Creating new tables with encrypted columns Yes Yes Yes Encrypting existing data in selected database columns Yes Yes No <p></p> <p>When setting up encryption for a column, you specify the information about the encryption algorithm and cryptographic keys used to protect the data in the column. Always Encrypted uses two types of keys: column encryption keys and column master keys. A column encryption key is used to encrypt data in an encrypted column. A column master key is a key-protecting key that encrypts one or more column encryption keys.</p> <p>The Database Engine stores encryption configuration for each column in database metadata. Note, however, the Database Engine never stores or uses the keys of either type in plaintext. It only stores encrypted values of column encryption keys and the information about the location of column master keys, which are stored in external trusted key stores, such as Azure Key Vault, Windows Certificate Store on a client machine, or a hardware security module.</p> <p>To access data stored in an encrypted column in plaintext, an application must use an Always Encrypted enabled client driver. When an application issues a parameterized query, the driver transparently collaborates with the Database Engine to determine which parameters target encrypted columns and, thus, should be encrypted. For each parameter that needs to be encrypted, the driver obtains the information about the encryption algorithm and the encrypted value of the column encryption key for the column, the parameter targets, as well as the location of its corresponding column master key.</p> <p>Next, the driver contacts the key store, containing the column master key, in order to decrypt the encrypted column encryption key value and then, it uses the plaintext column encryption key to encrypt the parameter. The resultant plaintext column encryption key is cached to reduce the number of round trips to the key store on subsequent uses of the same column encryption key. The driver substitutes the plaintext values of the parameters targeting encrypted columns with their encrypted values, and it sends the query to the server for processing.</p> <p>The server computes the result set, and for any encrypted columns included in the result set, the driver attaches the encryption metadata for the column, including the information about the encryption algorithm and the corresponding keys. The driver first tries to find the plaintext column encryption key in the local cache, and only makes a round to the column master key if it can't find the key in the cache. Next, the driver decrypts the results and returns plaintext values to the application.</p> <p>A client driver interacts with a key store, containing a column master key, using a column master key store provider, which is a client-side software component that encapsulates a key store containing the column master key. Providers for common types of key stores are available in client-side driver libraries from Microsoft or as standalone downloads. You can also implement your own provider. Always Encrypted capabilities, including built-in column master key store providers vary by a driver library and its version.</p> <p>Perform Try-This exercises</p> <pre><code>Note\n\nThese demonstrations require an Azure SQL database with sample data.

The illustration below displays Vault's core workflow.</p> <p></p> <p>The core Vault workflow consists of four stages:</p> <ul> <li>Authenticate: Authentication in Vault is the process by which a client supplies information that Vault uses to determine if they are who they say they are. Once the client is authenticated against an auth method, a token is generated and associated to a policy.</li> <li>Validation: Vault validates the client against third-party trusted sources, such as Github, LDAP, AppRole, and more.</li> <li>Authorize: A client is matched against the Vault security policy. This policy is a set of rules defining which API endpoints a client has access to with its Vault token. Policies provide a declarative way to grant or forbid access to certain paths and operations in Vault.</li> <li>Access: Vault grants access to secrets, keys, and encryption capabilities by issuing a token based on policies associated with the client\u2019s identity. The client can then use their Vault token for future operations.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Security/Hashicorp-vault/Hashicorp-vault.html#why-vault","title":"Why Vault?","text":"<p>Most enterprises today have credentials sprawled across their organizations. Passwords, API keys, and credentials are stored in plain text, app source code, config files, and other locations. Because these credentials live everywhere, the sprawl can make it difficult and daunting to really know who has access and authorization to what. Having credentials in plain text also increases the potential for malicious attacks, both by internal and external attackers.</p> <p>Vault was designed with these challenges in mind. Vault takes all of these credentials and centralizes them so that they are defined in one location, which reduces unwanted exposure to credentials. But Vault takes it a few steps further by making sure users, apps, and systems are authenticated and explicitly authorized to access resources, while also providing an audit trail that captures and preserves a history of clients' actions.</p> <p>The key features of Vault are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Secure Secret Storage: Arbitrary key/value secrets can be stored in Vault. Vault encrypts these secrets prior to writing them to persistent storage, so gaining access to the raw storage isn't enough to access your secrets. Vault can write to disk, Consul, and more.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dynamic Secrets: Vault can generate secrets on-demand for some systems, such as AWS or SQL databases. For example, when an application needs to access an S3 bucket, it asks Vault for credentials, and Vault will generate an AWS keypair with valid permissions on demand. After creating these dynamic secrets, Vault will also automatically revoke them after the lease is up.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data Encryption: Vault can encrypt and decrypt data without storing it. This allows security teams to define encryption parameters and developers to store encrypted data in a location such as a SQL database without having to design their own encryption methods.</p> </li> <li> <p>Leasing and Renewal: All secrets in Vault have a lease associated with them. At the end of the lease, Vault will automatically revoke that secret. Clients are able to renew leases via built-in renew APIs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Revocation: Vault has built-in support for secret revocation. Vault can revoke not only single secrets, but a tree of secrets, for example all secrets read by a specific user, or all secrets of a particular type. Revocation assists in key rolling as well as locking down systems in the case of an intrusion.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Security/Hashicorp-vault/Hashicorp-vault.html#what-is-hcp-vault","title":"What is HCP Vault?","text":"<p>HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) Vault is a hosted version of Vault, which is operated by HashiCorp to allow organizations to get up and running quickly.
