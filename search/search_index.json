This choice in identity solutions gives you the flexibility to use the most appropriate directory for your organization's needs.</p> <p>For example, if you mostly manage cloud-only users that run mobile devices, it may not make sense to build and run your own Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) identity solution. Instead, you could use Azure Active Directory.</p> <p></p> <p>Although the three Active Directory-based identity solutions share a common name and technology, they're designed to provide services that meet different customer demands. At a high level, these identity solutions and feature sets are:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) - Cloud-based identity and mobile device management that provides user account and authentication services for resources such as Microsoft 365, the Azure portal, or SaaS applications.</p> <ul> <li>Azure AD can be synchronized with an on-premises AD DS environment to provide a single identity to users that works natively in the cloud.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) - Enterprise-ready lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) server that provides key features such as identity and authentication, computer object management, group policy, and trusts.</p> <ul> <li>AD DS is a central component in many organizations with an on-premises IT environment and provides core user account authentication and computer management features.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure AD DS) - Provides managed domain services with a subset of fully compatible traditional AD DS features such as domain join, group policy, LDAP, and Kerberos / New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM) authentication.</p> <ul> <li>Azure AD DS integrates with Azure AD, which can synchronize with an on-premises AD DS environment.

Microsoft creates and manages the required resources.</li> <li>A self-managed domain that you create and configure using traditional resources such as virtual machines (VMs), Windows Server guest OS, and Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS). You then continue to administer these resources.</li> </ul> <p>With Azure AD DS, the core service components are deployed and maintained for you by Microsoft as a managed domain experience. You don't deploy, manage, patch, and secure the AD DS infrastructure for components like the VMs, Windows Server OS, or domain controllers (DCs).</p> <p>Azure AD DS provides a smaller subset of features to traditional self-managed AD DS environment, which reduces some of the design and management complexity. For example, there are no AD forests, domains, sites, and replication links to design and maintain.</p> <p>For applications and services that run in the cloud and need access to traditional authentication mechanisms such as Kerberos or NTLM, Azure AD DS provides a managed domain experience with a minimal amount of administrative overhead.</p> <p>When you deploy and run a self-managed AD DS environment, you must maintain all of the associated infrastructure and directory components. There's additional maintenance overhead with a self-managed AD DS environment, but you're then able to do additional tasks, such as extending the schema or create forest trusts.</p> <p>Common deployment models for a self-managed AD DS environment that provides identity to applications and services in the cloud include the following:</p> <ul> <li>Standalone cloud-only AD DS - Azure VMs are configured as domain controllers, and a separate, cloud-only AD DS environment is created. This AD DS environment doesn't integrate with an on-premises AD DS environment. A different set of credentials is used to sign in and administer VMs in the cloud.</li> <li>Resource forest deployment - Azure VMs are configured as domain controllers, and an AD DS domain that's part of an existing forest is created. A trust relationship is then configured to an on-premises AD DS environment. Other Azure VMs can domain-join this resource forest in the cloud. User authentication runs over a VPN / ExpressRoute connection to the on-premises AD DS environment.</li> <li>Extend on-premises domain to Azure - An Azure virtual network connects to an on-premises network using a VPN / ExpressRoute connection. Azure VMs connect to this Azure virtual network, which lets them domain-join to the on-premises AD DS environment.</li> </ul> <p>An alternative is to create Azure VMs and promote them as replica domain controllers from the on-premises AD DS domain. These domain controllers replicate over a VPN / ExpressRoute connection to the on-premises AD DS environment.

LDAP write support is available for objects created in the managed domain but not resources synchronized from Azure AD.</p> <p>The following features of Azure AD DS simplify deployment and management operations:</p> <ul> <li>Simplified deployment experience: Azure AD DS is enabled for your Azure AD tenant using a single wizard in the Azure portal. </li> <li>Integrated with Azure AD: User accounts, group memberships, and credentials are automatically available from your Azure AD tenant. New users, groups, or changes to attributes from your Azure AD tenant or your on-premises AD DS environment are automatically synchronized to Azure AD DS.<ul> <li>Accounts in external directories linked to your Azure AD aren't available in Azure AD DS. Credentials aren't available for those external directories, so they can't be synchronized into a managed domain.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Use your corporate credentials/passwords: Passwords for users in Azure AD DS are the same as in your Azure AD tenant. Users can use their corporate credentials to domain-join machines, sign in interactively or over a remote desktop, and authenticate against the managed domain.</li> <li>NTLM and Kerberos authentication: With support for NTLM and Kerberos authentication, you can deploy applications that rely on Windows-integrated authentication.</li> <li>High availability: Azure AD DS includes multiple domain controllers, which provide high availability for your managed domain. This high availability guarantees service uptime and resilience to failures.<ul> <li>In regions that support Azure Availability Zones, these domain controllers are distributed across zones for additional resiliency.</li> <li>Replica sets can also be used to provide geographical disaster recovery for legacy applications if an Azure region goes offline.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Some key aspects of a managed domain include the following:    - The managed domain is a stand-alone domain. It isn't an extension of an on-premises domain.        - If needed, you can create one-way outbound forest trusts from Azure AD DS to an on-premises AD DS environment.    - Your IT team doesn't need to manage, patch, or monitor domain controllers for this managed domain.</p> <p>For hybrid environments that run AD DS on-premises, you don't need to manage AD replication to the managed domain. User accounts, group memberships, and credentials from your on-premises directory are synchronized to Azure AD via Azure AD Connect. These user accounts, group memberships, and credentials are automatically available within the managed domain.</p> <pre><code>Important\n\nAzure AD DS integrates with Azure AD, which can synchronize with an on-premises AD DS environment. \nThis ability extends central identity use cases to traditional web applications that run in Azure as part of a lift-and-shift strategy.\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"Cloud/Azure/AZ-500/Manage-Identity-and-Access.html#create-and-manage-azure-ad-users","title":"Create and manage Azure AD users","text":"<p>Add new users or delete existing users from your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant.

Adding on key rolling, secure storage, and detailed audit logs is almost impossible without a custom solution. This is where Vault steps in.</p> <p>Vault validates and authorizes clients (users, machines, apps) before providing them access to secrets or stored sensitive data.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"Security/Hashicorp-vault/Hashicorp-vault.html#how-does-vault-work","title":"How does Vault work?","text":"<p>Vault works primarily with tokens and a token is associated to the client's policy. Each policy is path-based and policy rules constrains the actions and accessibility to the paths for each client. With Vault, you can create tokens manually and assign them to your clients, or the clients can log in and obtain a token. The illustration below displays Vault's core workflow.</p> <p></p> <p>The core Vault workflow consists of four stages:</p> <ul> <li>Authenticate: Authentication in Vault is the process by which a client supplies information that Vault uses to determine if they are who they say they are. Once the client is authenticated against an auth method, a token is generated and associated to a policy.</li> <li>Validation: Vault validates the client against third-party trusted sources, such as Github, LDAP, AppRole, and more.</li> <li>Authorize: A client is matched against the Vault security policy. This policy is a set of rules defining which API endpoints a client has access to with its Vault token. Policies provide a declarative way to grant or forbid access to certain paths and operations in Vault.</li> <li>Access: Vault grants access to secrets, keys, and encryption capabilities by issuing a token based on policies associated with the client\u2019s identity. The client can then use their Vault token for future operations.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Security/Hashicorp-vault/Hashicorp-vault.html#why-vault","title":"Why Vault?","text":"<p>Most enterprises today have credentials sprawled across their organizations. Passwords, API keys, and credentials are stored in plain text, app source code, config files, and other locations. Because these credentials live everywhere, the sprawl can make it difficult and daunting to really know who has access and authorization to what. Having credentials in plain text also increases the potential for malicious attacks, both by internal and external attackers.</p> <p>Vault was designed with these challenges in mind. Vault takes all of these credentials and centralizes them so that they are defined in one location, which reduces unwanted exposure to credentials. But Vault takes it a few steps further by making sure users, apps, and systems are authenticated and explicitly authorized to access resources, while also providing an audit trail that captures and preserves a history of clients' actions.</p> <p>The key features of Vault are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Secure Secret Storage: Arbitrary key/value secrets can be stored in Vault. Vault encrypts these secrets prior to writing them to persistent storage, so gaining access to the raw storage isn't enough to access your secrets. Vault can write to disk, Consul, and more.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dynamic Secrets: Vault can generate secrets on-demand for some systems, such as AWS or SQL databases. For example, when an application needs to access an S3 bucket, it asks Vault for credentials, and Vault will generate an AWS keypair with valid permissions on demand. After creating these dynamic secrets, Vault will also automatically revoke them after the lease is up.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data Encryption: Vault can encrypt and decrypt data without storing it. This allows security teams to define encryption parameters and developers to store encrypted data in a location such as a SQL database without having to design their own encryption methods.</p> </li> <li> <p>Leasing and Renewal: All secrets in Vault have a lease associated with them. At the end of the lease, Vault will automatically revoke that secret. Clients are able to renew leases via built-in renew APIs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Revocation: Vault has built-in support for secret revocation. Vault can revoke not only single secrets, but a tree of secrets, for example all secrets read by a specific user, or all secrets of a particular type. Revocation assists in key rolling as well as locking down systems in the case of an intrusion.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Security/Hashicorp-vault/Hashicorp-vault.html#what-is-hcp-vault","title":"What is HCP Vault?","text":"<p>HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) Vault is a hosted version of Vault, which is operated by HashiCorp to allow organizations to get up and running quickly.

This implies code changes to client applications along with additional testing and maintenance of the application.</p> <p>The following code example implements Vault API to authenticate with Vault through AppRole auth method, and then uses the returned client token to read secrets at kv-v2/data/creds.</p> <pre><code>package main\n\nimport (\n    ...snip...\n    vault \"github.com/hashicorp/vault/api\"\n)\n\n// Fetches a key-value secret (kv-v2) after authenticating via AppRole\nfunc getSecretWithAppRole() (string, error) {\n    config := vault.DefaultConfig()\n\n    client := vault.NewClient(config)\n    wrappingToken := ioutil.ReadFile(\"path/to/wrapping-token\")\n    unwrappedToken := client.Logical().Unwrap(strings.TrimSuffix(string(wrappingToken), \"\\n\"))\n\n    secretID := unwrappedToken.Data[\"secret_id\"]\n    roleID := os.Getenv(\"APPROLE_ROLE_ID\")\n\n    params := map[string]interface{}{\n        \"role_id\":   roleID,\n        \"secret_id\": secretID,\n    }\n    resp := client.Logical().Write(\"auth/approle/login\", params)\n    client.SetToken(resp.Auth.ClientToken)\n\n    secret, err := client.Logical().Read(\"kv-v2/data/creds\")\n    if err != nil {\n        return \"\", fmt.Errorf(\"unable to read secret: %w\", err)\n    }\n\n    data := secret.Data[\"data\"].(map[string]interface{})\n\n    ...snip...\n}\n</code></pre> <p>For some Vault deployments, making (and maintaining) these changes to applications may not be a problem, and may actually be preferred. This may be applied to scenarios where you have a small number of applications or you want to keep strict, customized control over how each application interacts with Vault. However, in other situations where you have a large number of applications, as in large enterprises, you may not have the resources or expertise to update and maintain the Vault integration code for every application. When third party applications are being deployed by the application, it is prohibited to add the Vault integration code.</p> <p>Vault Agent aims to remove this initial hurdle to adopt Vault by providing a more scalable and simpler way for applications to integrate with Vault.</p>"},{"location":"Security/Hashicorp-vault/Hashicorp-vault.html#what-is-vault-agent","title":"What is Vault Agent?","text":"<p>Vault Agent is a client daemon that provides the following features:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Auto-Auth - Automatically authenticate to Vault and manage the token renewal process for locally-retrieved dynamic secrets.</p> </li> <li> <p>API Proxy - Allows Vault Agent to act as a proxy for Vault's API, optionally using (or forcing the use of) the Auto-Auth token.</p> </li> <li> <p>Caching - Allows client-side caching of responses containing newly created tokens and responses containing leased secrets generated off of these newly created tokens.

Other secrets engines connect to other services and generate dynamic credentials on demand. Other secrets engines provide encryption as a service, totp generation, certificates, and much more.</p> <p>Secrets engines are enabled at a path in Vault.
