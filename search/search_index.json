This choice in identity solutions gives you the flexibility to use the most appropriate directory for your organization's needs.</p> <p>For example, if you mostly manage cloud-only users that run mobile devices, it may not make sense to build and run your own Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) identity solution. Instead, you could use Azure Active Directory.</p> <p></p> <p>Although the three Active Directory-based identity solutions share a common name and technology, they're designed to provide services that meet different customer demands. At a high level, these identity solutions and feature sets are:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) - Cloud-based identity and mobile device management that provides user account and authentication services for resources such as Microsoft 365, the Azure portal, or SaaS applications.         -- Azure AD can be synchronized with an on-premises AD DS environment to provide a single identity to users that works natively in the cloud.</p> </li> <li> <p>Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) - Enterprise-ready lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) server that provides key features such as identity and authentication, computer object management, group policy, and trusts.         -- AD DS is a central component in many organizations with an on-premises IT environment and provides core user account authentication and computer management features.</p> </li> <li> <p>Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure AD DS) - Provides managed domain services with a subset of fully compatible traditional AD DS features such as domain join, group policy, LDAP, and Kerberos / New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM) authentication.         -- Azure AD DS integrates with Azure AD, which can synchronize with an on-premises AD DS environment. This ability extends central identity use cases to traditional web applications that run in Azure as part of a lift-and-shift strategy.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"Cloud/Azure/Security-az-500.html#azure-ad-ds-and-self-managed-ad-ds","title":"Azure AD DS and self-managed AD DS","text":"<p>If you have applications and services that need access to traditional authentication mechanisms such as Kerberos or NTLM, there are two ways to provide Active Directory Domain Services in the cloud:</p> <pre><code>    -- A managed domain that you create using Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure AD DS). Microsoft creates and manages the required resources.\n    -- A self-managed domain that you create and configure using traditional resources such as virtual machines (VMs), Windows Server guest OS, and Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS). You then continue to administer these resources.\n</code></pre> <p>With Azure AD DS, the core service components are deployed and maintained for you by Microsoft as a managed domain experience. You don't deploy, manage, patch, and secure the AD DS infrastructure for components like the VMs, Windows Server OS, or domain controllers (DCs).</p> <p>Azure AD DS provides a smaller subset of features to traditional self-managed AD DS environment, which reduces some of the design and management complexity. For example, there are no AD forests, domains, sites, and replication links to design and maintain.</p> <p>For applications and services that run in the cloud and need access to traditional authentication mechanisms such as Kerberos or NTLM, Azure AD DS provides a managed domain experience with a minimal amount of administrative overhead.</p> <p>When you deploy and run a self-managed AD DS environment, you must maintain all of the associated infrastructure and directory components. There's additional maintenance overhead with a self-managed AD DS environment, but you're then able to do additional tasks, such as extending the schema or create forest trusts.</p> <p>Common deployment models for a self-managed AD DS environment that provides identity to applications and services in the cloud include the following:         -- Standalone cloud-only AD DS - Azure VMs are configured as domain controllers, and a separate, cloud-only AD DS environment is created. This AD DS environment doesn't integrate with an on-premises AD DS environment. A different set of credentials is used to sign in and administer VMs in the cloud.         -- Resource forest deployment - Azure VMs are configured as domain controllers, and an AD DS domain that's part of an existing forest is created. A trust relationship is then configured to an on-premises AD DS environment. Other Azure VMs can domain-join this resource forest in the cloud. User authentication runs over a VPN / ExpressRoute connection to the on-premises AD DS environment.         -- Extend on-premises domain to Azure - An Azure virtual network connects to an on-premises network using a VPN / ExpressRoute connection. Azure VMs connect to this Azure virtual network, which lets them domain-join to the on-premises AD DS environment.                 -- An alternative is to create Azure VMs and promote them as replica domain controllers from the on-premises AD DS domain. These domain controllers replicate over a VPN / ExpressRoute connection to the on-premises AD DS environment. The on-premises AD DS domain is effectively extended into Azure.</p> <p>The following table outlines some of the features you may need for your organization and the differences between a managed Azure AD DS domain or a self-managed AD DS domain:</p> Feature Azure Active Directory Services (Azure AD DS) Self-managed AD DS Managed service \u2713 \u2715 Secure deployments \u2713 The administrator secures the deployment Domain Name System (DNS) server \u2713 (managed service) \u2713 Domain or Enterprise administrator privileges \u2715 \u2713 Domain join \u2713 \u2713 Domain authentication using New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM) and Kerberos \u2713 \u2713 Kerberos constrained delegation Resource-based Resource-based &amp; account-based Custom organizational unit (OU) structure \u2713 \u2713 Group Policy \u2713 \u2713 Schema extensions \u2715 \u2713 Active Directory domain/forest trusts \u2713 (one-way outbound forest trusts only) \u2713 Secure Lightweight Directory Access Protocols (LDAPs) \u2713 \u2713 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) read \u2713 \u2713 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) write \u2713 (within the managed domain) \u2713 Geographical-distributed (Geo-distributed) deployments \u2713 \u2713"},{"location":"Cloud/Azure/Security-az-500.html#azure-ad-ds-and-azure-ad","title":"Azure AD DS and Azure AD","text":"<p>Azure AD lets you manage the identity of devices used by the organization and control access to corporate resources from those devices. Users can also register their personal device (a bring-your-own (BYO) model) with Azure AD, which provides the device with an identity.

The device can be managed using Mobile Device Management (MDM) software like Microsoft Intune. This management ability lets you restrict access to sensitive resources to managed and policy-compliant devices.</p> <p>Traditional computers and laptops can also join Azure AD.

End-user mobile or desktop devices Server VMs deployed in Azure <p>If on-premises AD DS and Azure AD are configured for federated authentication using Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS), then there's no (current/valid) password hash available in Azure DS.

For example, Exchange Administrator, Intune Administrator, SharePoint Administrator, and Teams Administrator roles can manage features with their respective services. Exchange Administrator can manage mailboxes, Intune Administrator can manage device policies, SharePoint Administrator can manage site collections, Teams Administrator can manage call qualities, and so on.\n\n    -- Cross-service roles: There are some roles that span services. We have two global roles - Global Administrator and Global Reader. All Microsoft 365 services honor these two roles. Also, there are some security-related roles like Security Administrator and Security Reader that grant access across multiple security services within Microsoft 365. For example, using Security Administrator roles in Azure AD, you can manage Microsoft 365 Defender portal, Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection, and Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps.

Adding on key rolling, secure storage, and detailed audit logs is almost impossible without a custom solution.

Each policy is path-based and policy rules constrains the actions and accessibility to the paths for each client. With Vault, you can create tokens manually and assign them to your clients, or the clients can log in and obtain a token. The illustration below displays Vault's core workflow.</p> <p></p> <p>The core Vault workflow consists of four stages:</p> <ul> <li>Authenticate: Authentication in Vault is the process by which a client supplies information that Vault uses to determine if they are who they say they are. Once the client is authenticated against an auth method, a token is generated and associated to a policy.</li> <li>Validation: Vault validates the client against third-party trusted sources, such as Github, LDAP, AppRole, and more.</li> <li>Authorize: A client is matched against the Vault security policy. This policy is a set of rules defining which API endpoints a client has access to with its Vault token. Policies provide a declarative way to grant or forbid access to certain paths and operations in Vault.</li> <li>Access: Vault grants access to secrets, keys, and encryption capabilities by issuing a token based on policies associated with the client\u2019s identity. The client can then use their Vault token for future operations.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Security/Hashicorp-vault/Hashicorp-vault.html#why-vault","title":"Why Vault?","text":"<p>Most enterprises today have credentials sprawled across their organizations. Passwords, API keys, and credentials are stored in plain text, app source code, config files, and other locations. Because these credentials live everywhere, the sprawl can make it difficult and daunting to really know who has access and authorization to what. Having credentials in plain text also increases the potential for malicious attacks, both by internal and external attackers.</p> <p>Vault was designed with these challenges in mind. Vault takes all of these credentials and centralizes them so that they are defined in one location, which reduces unwanted exposure to credentials. But Vault takes it a few steps further by making sure users, apps, and systems are authenticated and explicitly authorized to access resources, while also providing an audit trail that captures and preserves a history of clients' actions.</p> <p>The key features of Vault are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Secure Secret Storage: Arbitrary key/value secrets can be stored in Vault. Vault encrypts these secrets prior to writing them to persistent storage, so gaining access to the raw storage isn't enough to access your secrets. Vault can write to disk, Consul, and more.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dynamic Secrets: Vault can generate secrets on-demand for some systems, such as AWS or SQL databases. For example, when an application needs to access an S3 bucket, it asks Vault for credentials, and Vault will generate an AWS keypair with valid permissions on demand. After creating these dynamic secrets, Vault will also automatically revoke them after the lease is up.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data Encryption: Vault can encrypt and decrypt data without storing it. This allows security teams to define encryption parameters and developers to store encrypted data in a location such as a SQL database without having to design their own encryption methods.</p> </li> <li> <p>Leasing and Renewal: All secrets in Vault have a lease associated with them. At the end of the lease, Vault will automatically revoke that secret. Clients are able to renew leases via built-in renew APIs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Revocation: Vault has built-in support for secret revocation. Vault can revoke not only single secrets, but a tree of secrets, for example all secrets read by a specific user, or all secrets of a particular type. Revocation assists in key rolling as well as locking down systems in the case of an intrusion.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Security/Hashicorp-vault/Hashicorp-vault.html#what-is-hcp-vault","title":"What is HCP Vault?","text":"<p>HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) Vault is a hosted version of Vault, which is operated by HashiCorp to allow organizations to get up and running quickly.

When a secrets engine is disabled, all of its secrets are revoked (if they support it), and all the data stored for that engine in the physical storage layer is deleted.</p> </li> <li> <p>Move - This moves the path for an existing secrets engine. This process revokes all secrets, since secret leases are tied to the path where they were created. The configuration data stored for the engine persists through the move.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tune - This tunes global configuration for the secrets engine such as the TTLs.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Once a secrets engine is enabled, you can interact with it directly at its path according to its own API.
