<p>Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is a cloud-based identity and access management service. This service helps employees access external resources, such as Microsoft 365, the Azure portal, and thousands of other software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications. Azure Active Directory also helps them access internal resources like apps on your corporate intranet network, along with any cloud apps developed for your organization.</p>

<h2 id="who-uses-azure-ad"><strong>Who uses Azure AD?</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#who-uses-azure-ad" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Azure AD is intended for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>IT admins: As an IT admin, use Azure AD to control access to your apps and your app resources based on your business requirements. For example, you can use Azure AD to require multi-factor authentication when accessing important organizational resources. You can also use Azure AD to automate user provisioning between your existing Windows Server AD and your cloud apps, including Microsoft 365. Finally, Azure AD gives you powerful tools to automatically help protect user identities and credentials and to meet your access governance requirements.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>App developers: As an app developer, you can use Azure AD as a standards-based approach for adding single sign-on (SSO) to your app, allowing it to work with a user's pre-existing credentials. Azure AD also provides APIs that can help you build personalized app experiences using existing organizational data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Microsoft 365, Office 365, Azure, or Dynamics Customer relationship management (CRM) Online subscribers: As a subscriber, you're already using Azure AD. Each Microsoft 365, Office 365, Azure, and Dynamics CRM Online tenant is automatically an Azure AD tenant. You can immediately start to manage access to your integrated cloud apps.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-are-the-azure-ad-licenses"><strong>What are the Azure AD licenses?</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-the-azure-ad-licenses" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Microsoft Online business services, such as Microsoft 365 or Microsoft Azure, require Azure AD for sign-in activities and to help with identity protection. If you subscribe to any Microsoft Online business service, you automatically get Azure AD with access to all the free features.</p>
<p>To enhance your Azure AD implementation, you can also add paid capabilities by upgrading to Azure Active Directory Premium P1 or Premium P2 licenses. </p>
<p>Azure AD paid licenses are built on top of your existing free directory. The licenses provide self-service, enhanced monitoring, security reporting, and secure access for your mobile users.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Azure Active Directory Free:</strong> Provides user and group management, on-premises directory synchronization, basic reports, self-service password change for cloud users, and single sign-on across Azure, Microsoft 365, and many popular SaaS apps.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Azure Active Directory Premium P1:</strong> In addition to the Free features, P1 lets your hybrid users access both on-premises and cloud resources. It also supports advanced administration, such as dynamic groups, self-service group management, Microsoft Identity Manager, and cloud write-back capabilities, which allow self-service password reset for your on-premises users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Azure Active Directory Premium P2:</strong> In addition to the Free and P1 features, P2 also offers Azure Active Directory Identity Protection to help provide risk-based Conditional Access to your apps and critical company data and Privileged Identity Management to help discover, restrict, and monitor administrators and their access to resources and to provide just-in-time access when needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Pay as you go" feature licenses:</strong> You also get additional feature licenses, such as Azure Active Directory Business-to-Customer (B2C). B2C can help you provide identity and access management solutions for your customer-facing apps.</p>

<p>To provide applications, services, or devices access to a central identity, there are three common ways to use Active Directory-based services in Azure. This choice in identity solutions gives you the flexibility to use the most appropriate directory for your organization's needs.</p>
<p>For example, if you mostly manage cloud-only users that run mobile devices, it may not make sense to build and run your own Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) identity solution. Instead, you could use Azure Active Directory.</p>
<p><img alt="Design Flow1" src="image/AZ-500-2.png" /></p>
<p>Although the three Active Directory-based identity solutions share a common name and technology, they're designed to provide services that meet different customer demands. At a high level, these identity solutions and feature sets are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) -</strong> Cloud-based identity and mobile device management that provides user account and authentication services for resources such as Microsoft 365, the Azure portal, or SaaS applications.</p>
<ul>
<li>Azure AD can be synchronized with an on-premises AD DS environment to provide a single identity to users that works natively in the cloud.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) -</strong> Enterprise-ready lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) server that provides key features such as identity and authentication, computer object management, group policy, and trusts.</p>
<ul>
<li>AD DS is a central component in many organizations with an on-premises IT environment and provides core user account authentication and computer management features.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure AD DS) -</strong> Provides managed domain services with a subset of fully compatible traditional AD DS features such as domain join, group policy, LDAP, and Kerberos / New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM) authentication.</p>
<ul>
<li>Azure AD DS integrates with Azure AD, which can synchronize with an on-premises AD DS environment. This ability extends central identity use cases to traditional web applications that run in Azure as part of a lift-and-shift strategy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="azure-ad-ds-and-self-managed-ad-ds"><strong>Azure AD DS and self-managed AD DS</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#azure-ad-ds-and-self-managed-ad-ds" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>If you have applications and services that need access to traditional authentication mechanisms such as Kerberos or NTLM, there are two ways to provide Active Directory Domain Services in the cloud:</p>
<ul>
<li>A managed domain that you create using Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure AD DS). Microsoft creates and manages the required resources.</li>
<li>A self-managed domain that you create and configure using traditional resources such as virtual machines (VMs), Windows Server guest OS, and Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS). You then continue to administer these resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>With Azure AD DS, the core service components are deployed and maintained for you by Microsoft as a managed domain experience. You don't deploy, manage, patch, and secure the AD DS infrastructure for components like the VMs, Windows Server OS, or domain controllers (DCs).</p>
<p>Azure AD DS provides a smaller subset of features to traditional self-managed AD DS environment, which reduces some of the design and management complexity. For example, there are no AD forests, domains, sites, and replication links to design and maintain.</p>
<p>For applications and services that run in the cloud and need access to traditional authentication mechanisms such as Kerberos or NTLM, Azure AD DS provides a managed domain experience with a minimal amount of administrative overhead.</p>
<p>When you deploy and run a self-managed AD DS environment, you must maintain all of the associated infrastructure and directory components. There's additional maintenance overhead with a self-managed AD DS environment, but you're then able to do additional tasks, such as extending the schema or create forest trusts.</p>
<p>Common deployment models for a self-managed AD DS environment that provides identity to applications and services in the cloud include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standalone cloud-only AD DS -</strong> Azure VMs are configured as domain controllers, and a separate, cloud-only AD DS environment is created. This AD DS environment doesn't integrate with an on-premises AD DS environment. A different set of credentials is used to sign in and administer VMs in the cloud.</li>
<li><strong>Resource forest deployment -</strong> Azure VMs are configured as domain controllers, and an AD DS domain that's part of an existing forest is created. A trust relationship is then configured to an on-premises AD DS environment. Other Azure VMs can domain-join this resource forest in the cloud. User authentication runs over a VPN / ExpressRoute connection to the on-premises AD DS environment.</li>
<li><strong>Extend on-premises domain to Azure -</strong> An Azure virtual network connects to an on-premises network using a VPN / ExpressRoute connection. Azure VMs connect to this Azure virtual network, which lets them domain-join to the on-premises AD DS environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>An alternative is to create Azure VMs and promote them as replica domain controllers from the on-premises AD DS domain. These domain controllers replicate over a VPN / ExpressRoute connection to the on-premises AD DS environment. The on-premises AD DS domain is effectively extended into Azure.</p>
<p>The following table outlines some of the features you may need for your organization and the differences between a managed Azure AD DS domain or a self-managed AD DS domain:</p>

<p>Azure AD lets you manage the identity of devices used by the organization and control access to corporate resources from those devices. Users can also register their personal device (a bring-your-own (BYO) model) with Azure AD, which provides the device with an identity. Azure AD then authenticates the device when a user signs in to Azure AD and uses the device to access secured resources. The device can be managed using Mobile Device Management (MDM) software like Microsoft Intune. This management ability lets you restrict access to sensitive resources to managed and policy-compliant devices.</p>
<p>Traditional computers and laptops can also join Azure AD. This mechanism offers the same benefits of registering a personal device with Azure AD, such as allowing users to sign in to the device using their corporate credentials.</p>
<p>Azure AD joined devices give you the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single sign-on (SSO) to applications secured by Azure AD.</li>
<li>Enterprise policy-compliant roaming of user settings across devices.</li>
<li>Access to the Windows Store for Business using corporate credentials.</li>
<li>Windows Hello for Business.</li>
<li>Restricted access to apps and resources from devices compliant with corporate policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Devices can be joined to Azure AD with or without a hybrid deployment that includes an on-premises AD DS environment. The following table outlines common device ownership models and how they would typically be joined to a domain:</p>
<table>

<p>On an Azure AD-joined or registered device, user authentication happens using modern OAuth / OpenID Connect-based protocols. These protocols are designed to work over the internet, so are great for mobile scenarios where users access corporate resources from anywhere.</p>
<p>With Azure AD DS-joined devices, applications can use the Kerberos and New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM) protocols for authentication, so can support legacy applications migrated to run on Azure VMs as part of a lift-and-shift strategy. The following table outlines differences in how the devices are represented and can authenticate themselves against the directory:</p>

<p>If on-premises AD DS and Azure AD are configured for federated authentication using Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS), then there's no (current/valid) password hash available in Azure DS. Azure AD user accounts created before fed auth was implemented might have an old password hash that doesn't match a hash of their on-premises password. Hence Azure AD DS won't validate the user's credentials.</p>

<h2 id="categories-of-azure-ad-roles"><strong>Categories of Azure AD roles</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#categories-of-azure-ad-roles" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Azure AD built-in roles differ in where they can be used, which fall into the following three broad categories.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Azure AD-specific roles:</strong> These roles grant permissions to manage resources within Azure AD only. For example, User Administrator, Application Administrator, and Groups Administrator all grant permissions to manage resources that live in Azure AD.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Service-specific roles:</strong> For major Microsoft 365 services (non-Azure AD), we have built service-specific roles that grant permissions to manage all features within the service. For example, Exchange Administrator, Intune Administrator, SharePoint Administrator, and Teams Administrator roles can manage features with their respective services. Exchange Administrator can manage mailboxes, Intune Administrator can manage device policies, SharePoint Administrator can manage site collections, Teams Administrator can manage call qualities, and so on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cross-service roles:</strong> There are some roles that span services. We have two global roles - Global Administrator and Global Reader. All Microsoft 365 services honor these two roles. Also, there are some security-related roles like Security Administrator and Security Reader that grant access across multiple security services within Microsoft 365. For example, using Security Administrator roles in Azure AD, you can manage Microsoft 365 Defender portal, Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection, and Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps. Similarly, in the Compliance Administrator role, you can manage Compliance-related settings in the Compliance portal, Exchange, and so on.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>An Azure AD DS managed domain lets you run legacy applications in the cloud that can't use modern authentication methods or where you don't want directory lookups to always go back to an on-premises AD DS environment. You can lift and shift those legacy applications from your on-premises environment into a managed domain without needing to manage the AD DS environment in the cloud.</p>
<p>Azure AD DS integrates with your existing Azure AD tenant. This integration lets users sign in to services and applications connected to the managed domain using their existing credentials. You can also use existing groups and user accounts to secure access to resources. These features provide a smoother lift-and-shift of on-premises resources to Azure.</p>

<p>When you create an Azure AD DS managed domain, you define a unique namespace. This namespace is the domain name, such as aaddscontoso.com. Two Windows Server domain controllers (DCs) are then deployed into your selected Azure region. This deployment of DCs is known as a replica set.</p>
<p>You don't need to manage, configure, or update these DCs. The Azure platform handles the DCs as part of the managed domain, including backups and encryption at rest using Azure Disk Encryption.</p>
<p>A managed domain is configured to perform a one-way synchronization from Azure AD to provide access to a central set of users, groups, and credentials. You can create resources directly in the managed domain, but they aren't synchronized back to Azure AD. Applications, services, and VMs in Azure that connect to the managed domain can then use common AD DS features such as domain join, group policy, LDAP, and Kerberos/NTLM authentication.</p>
<p>In a hybrid environment with an on-premises AD DS environment, Azure AD Connect synchronizes identity information with Azure AD, which is then synchronized to the managed domain.</p>
<p><img alt="Design Flow1" src="image/AZ-500-4.png" /></p>
<p>Azure AD DS replicates identity information from Azure AD, so it works with Azure AD tenants that are cloud-only or synchronized with an on-premises AD DS environment. The same set of Azure AD DS features exists for both environments.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have an existing on-premises AD DS environment, you can synchronize user account information to provide a consistent identity for users.</li>
<li>For cloud-only environments, you don't need a traditional on-premises AD DS environment to use the centralized identity services of Azure AD DS.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can expand a managed domain to have more than one replica set per Azure AD tenant. Replica sets can be added to any peered virtual network in any Azure region that supports Azure AD DS. Additional replica sets in different Azure regions provide geographical disaster recovery for legacy applications if an Azure region goes offline.</p>
<h2 id="azure-ad-ds-features-and-benefits"><strong>Azure AD DS features and benefits</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#azure-ad-ds-features-and-benefits" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>To provide identity services to applications and VMs in the cloud, Azure AD DS is fully compatible with a traditional AD DS environment for operations such as domain-join, secure LDAP (LDAPS), Group Policy, DNS management, and LDAP bind and read support. LDAP write support is available for objects created in the managed domain but not resources synchronized from Azure AD.</p>
<p>The following features of Azure AD DS simplify deployment and management operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simplified deployment experience: Azure AD DS is enabled for your Azure AD tenant using a single wizard in the Azure portal. </li>
<li>Integrated with Azure AD: User accounts, group memberships, and credentials are automatically available from your Azure AD tenant. New users, groups, or changes to attributes from your Azure AD tenant or your on-premises AD DS environment are automatically synchronized to Azure AD DS.<ul>
<li>Accounts in external directories linked to your Azure AD aren't available in Azure AD DS. Credentials aren't available for those external directories, so they can't be synchronized into a managed domain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use your corporate credentials/passwords: Passwords for users in Azure AD DS are the same as in your Azure AD tenant. Users can use their corporate credentials to domain-join machines, sign in interactively or over a remote desktop, and authenticate against the managed domain.</li>
<li>NTLM and Kerberos authentication: With support for NTLM and Kerberos authentication, you can deploy applications that rely on Windows-integrated authentication.</li>
<li>High availability: Azure AD DS includes multiple domain controllers, which provide high availability for your managed domain. This high availability guarantees service uptime and resilience to failures.<ul>
<li>In regions that support Azure Availability Zones, these domain controllers are distributed across zones for additional resiliency.</li>
<li>Replica sets can also be used to provide geographical disaster recovery for legacy applications if an Azure region goes offline.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some key aspects of a managed domain include the following:
   - The managed domain is a stand-alone domain. It isn't an extension of an on-premises domain.
       - If needed, you can create one-way outbound forest trusts from Azure AD DS to an on-premises AD DS environment.
   - Your IT team doesn't need to manage, patch, or monitor domain controllers for this managed domain.</p>
<p>For hybrid environments that run AD DS on-premises, you don't need to manage AD replication to the managed domain. User accounts, group memberships, and credentials from your on-premises directory are synchronized to Azure AD via Azure AD Connect. These user accounts, group memberships, and credentials are automatically available within the managed domain.</p>
<pre><code>Important

Azure AD DS integrates with Azure AD, which can synchronize with an on-premises AD DS environment. 
This ability extends central identity use cases to traditional web applications that run in Azure as part of a lift-and-shift strategy.

<h1 id="manage-users-with-azure-ad-groups"><strong>Manage users with Azure AD groups</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#manage-users-with-azure-ad-groups" title="Permanent link">#</a></h1>
<p>Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) provides several ways to manage access to resources, applications, and tasks. With Azure AD groups, you can grant access and permissions to a group of users instead of each individual user. Limiting access to Azure AD resources to only those users who need access is one of the core security principles of Zero Trust.</p>
<p>Azure AD lets you use groups to manage access to applications, data, and resources. Resources can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Part of the Azure AD organization, such as permissions to manage objects through roles in Azure AD</li>
<li>External to the organization, such as for Software as a Service (SaaS) apps</li>
<li>Azure services</li>
<li>SharePoint sites</li>
<li>On-premises resources</li>
</ul>
<p>Some groups can't be managed in the Azure AD portal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Groups synced from on-premises Active Directory can be managed only in on-premises Active Directory.</li>
<li>Distribution lists and mail-enabled security groups are managed only in Exchange admin center or Microsoft 365 admin center. You must sign in to the Exchange admin center or Microsoft 365 admin center to manage these groups.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-to-know-before-creating-a-group"><strong>What to know before creating a group</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#what-to-know-before-creating-a-group" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>There are two group types and three group membership types.</p>
<h1 id="group-types"><strong>Group types:</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#group-types" title="Permanent link">#</a></h1>
<p><strong>Security:</strong> Used to manage user and computer access to shared resources.
For example, you can create a security group so that all group members have the same set of security permissions. Members of a security group can include users, devices, other groups, and service principals, which define access policy and permissions. Owners of a security group can include users and service principals.</p>
<p>Microsoft 365: Provides collaboration opportunities by giving group members access to a shared mailbox, calendar, files, SharePoint sites, and more.</p>
<p>This option also lets you give people outside of your organization access to the group. Members of a Microsoft 365 group can only include users. Owners of a Microsoft 365 group can include users and service principals.</p>
<h2 id="membership-types"><strong>Membership types:</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#membership-types" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Assigned: Lets you add specific users as members of a group and have unique permissions.</li>
<li>Dynamic user: Lets you use dynamic membership rules to automatically add and remove members. If a member's attributes change, the system looks at your dynamic group rules for the directory to see if the member meets the rule requirements (is added), or no longer meets the rules requirements (is removed).
Dynamic device: Lets you use dynamic group rules to automatically add and remove devices. If a device's attributes change, the system looks at your dynamic group rules for the directory to see if the device meets the rule requirements (is added), or no longer meets the rules requirements (is removed).</li>
</ul>
<p>Important</p>
<p>You can create a dynamic group for either devices or users but not for both. You can't create a device group based on the device owners' attributes. Device membership rules can only reference device attributions.</p>
<h2 id="configure-azure-ad-administrative-units"><strong>Configure Azure AD administrative units</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#configure-azure-ad-administrative-units" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>An administrative unit is an Azure AD resource that can be a container for other Azure AD resources. An administrative unit can contain only users and groups. Administrative units restrict permissions in a role to any portion of your organization that you define. You could, for example, use administrative units to delegate the Helpdesk Administrator role to regional support specialists, so they can manage users only in the region that they support.</p>
<pre><code>Note

To use administrative units, you need an Azure Active Directory Premium license for each administrative unit admin, 
and Azure Active Directory Free licenses for administrative unit members.

<h2 id="implement-passwordless-authentication"><strong>Implement passwordless authentication</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#implement-passwordless-authentication" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Features like multifactor authentication (MFA) are a great way to secure your organization. Still, users often get frustrated with the additional security layer on top of having to remember their passwords. Passwordless authentication methods are more convenient because the password is removed and replaced with something you have, plus something you are or something you know.</p>

<p>Each organization has different needs when it comes to authentication. Microsoft global Azure and Azure Government offer the following three passwordless authentication options that integrate with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD):
   1. Windows Hello for Business
   2. Microsoft Authenticator
   3. Fast Identity Online2 (FIDO2) security keys</p>
<p><img alt="Design Flow1" src="image/AZ-500-7.png" /></p>
<h2 id="windows-hello-for-business"><strong>Windows Hello for Business</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#windows-hello-for-business" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Windows Hello for Business is ideal for information workers that have their own designated Windows PC. The biometric and PIN credentials are directly tied to the user's PC, which prevents access from anyone other than the owner. With public key infrastructure (PKI) integration and built-in support for single sign-on (SSO), Windows Hello for Business provides a convenient method for seamlessly accessing corporate resources on-premises and in the cloud.</p>
<h2 id="microsoft-authenticator"><strong>Microsoft Authenticator</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#microsoft-authenticator" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>You can also allow your employee's phone to become a passwordless authentication method. You may already be using the Authenticator app as a convenient multi-factor authentication option in addition to a password. You can also use the Authenticator App as a passwordless option.</p>
<h2 id="fast-identity-online2-fido2-security-keys"><strong>Fast Identity Online2 (FIDO2) security keys:</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#fast-identity-online2-fido2-security-keys" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance helps to promote open authentication standards and reduce the use of passwords as a form of authentication. FIDO2 is the latest standard that incorporates the web authentication (WebAuthn) standard.</p>
<p>FIDO2 security keys are an unphishable standards-based passwordless authentication method that can come in any form factor. Fast Identity Online (FIDO) is an open standard for passwordless authentication. FIDO allows users and organizations to leverage the standard to sign in to their resources without a username or password using an external security key or a platform key built into a device.</p>
<p>Users can register and then select a FIDO2 security key at the sign-in interface as their main means of authentication. These FIDO2 security keys are typically USB devices but could also use Bluetooth or Near-Field Communication (NFC). With a hardware device that handles the authentication, the security of an account is increased as there's no password that could be exposed or guessed.</p>
<p>FIDO2 security keys can be used to sign into their Azure AD or hybrid Azure AD joined Windows 10 devices and get single-sign-on to their cloud and on-premises resources. Users can also sign in to supported browsers. FIDO2 security keys are a great option for enterprises that are very security sensitive or have scenarios or employees who aren't willing or able to use their phone as a second factor.</p>

<p>Azure AD Connect will integrate your on-premises directories with Azure Active Directory. This allows you to provide a common identity for your users for Microsoft 365, Azure, and SaaS applications integrated with Azure AD.</p>
<p><img alt="Design Flow1" src="image/AZ-500-8.png" /></p>
<p>Azure AD Connect provides the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Password hash synchronization</strong>. A sign-in method that synchronizes a hash of a users on-premises AD password with Azure AD.</li>
<li><strong>Pass-through authentication</strong>. A sign-in method that allows users to use the same password on-premises and in the cloud, but doesn't require the additional infrastructure of a federated environment.</li>
<li><strong>Federation integration</strong>. Federation is an optional part of Azure AD Connect and can be used to configure a hybrid environment using an on-premises AD FS infrastructure. It also provides AD FS management capabilities such as certificate renewal and additional AD FS server deployments.</li>
<li><strong>Synchronization</strong>. Responsible for creating users, groups, and other objects. As well as, making sure identity information for your on-premises users and groups is matching the cloud. This synchronization also includes password hashes.</li>
<li><strong>Health Monitoring</strong>. Azure AD Connect Health can provide robust monitoring and provide a central location in the Azure portal to view this activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you integrate your on-premises directories with Azure AD, your users are more productive because there's a common identity to access both cloud and on-premises resources. However, this integration creates the challenge of ensuring that this environment is healthy so that users can reliably access resources both on premises and in the cloud from any device.</p>
<p><img alt="Design Flow1" src="image/AZ-500-9.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Connect Health</strong> provides robust monitoring of your on-premises identity infrastructure. It enables you to maintain a reliable connection to Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Online Services. This reliability is achieved by providing monitoring capabilities for your key identity components. Also, it makes the key data points about these components easily accessible. Azure AD Connect Health helps you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monitor and gain insights into AD FS servers, Azure AD Connect, and AD domain controllers.</li>
<li>Monitor and gain insights into the synchronizations that occur between your on-premises AD DS and Azure AD.</li>
<li>Monitor and gain insights into your on-premises identity infrastructure that is used to access Microsoft 365 or other Azure AD applications</li>
</ul>
<p>With Azure AD Connect the key data you need is easily accessible. You can view and act on alerts, setup email notifications for critical alerts, and view performance data.</p>
<pre><code>Important

Using AD Connect Health works by installing an agent on each of your on-premises sync servers.
